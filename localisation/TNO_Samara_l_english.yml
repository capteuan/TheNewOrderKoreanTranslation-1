 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 SAM_ANDREY_VLASOV_DESC:0 "붉은군대의 변절자 장군 안드레이 안드레이예비치 블라소프의 이름은 많은 러시아인들에게 여전히 민감한 주제다. 그의 몇 안 되는 지지자들에게 블라소프는 군사적으로 우월한 정복자에게 현명하게 굴복한 다음 그들의 후원을 이용하여 장차 강력하고 독립적인 러시아 국가를 위한 발판을 마련한 이반 1세의 현대판 인물로 묘사되고 있다. 그러나 대부분의 옛 소련 시민들에게는 그의 이름이 유다에 버금가는 가장 극악한 배신의 대명사로 불리고 있다. 물론 블라소프의 실제 성격은 그것보다 훨씬 덜하긴 하다.\n\n망신을 당한 장군이 독일군의 총검으로 적군의 위협을 뚫으려는 진심 어린 열망에 이끌렸는지, 아니면 나치와 동맹을 맺었을 때 살아남고자 하는 단순한 충동에 이끌렸는지는 말하기 어렵지만, 어떤 동기를 가졌든 독일군 최고사령부는 결코 그를 주목할 만한 동맹으로 여기지 않았고, 그의 조국이 독일의 군홧발에 짓밟히는 것을 후방에서 멀찍이 지켜볼 수 있도록 해주었을 뿐이었다.\n\n 블라소프가 독일인들과 러시아인들에게 재평가를 받을 만한 마지막 기회가 서러시아 전쟁 중에 나타났는데, 이때 그의 러시아 해방군이 서러시아 혁명 전선의 공세에 맞서 전세를 역전시키는 데 일조했다. 비록 그는 소비에트를 물리치는 데 도움을 주었고 이를 통해 사마라 인근의 영토를 획득하였지만, 독일인들은 여전히 그를 짧은 사슬에 묶어 두고 세심하게 지켜볼 개 이상의 존재로 보지 않았다. 그의 주인들에게 능욕을 당하고, 러시아를 해방시키는 데 있어 그의 비굴한 태도를 장애물로 여기기 시작한, 한때 믿을 만했던 장교들 사이에서 인기가 떨어진 블라소프는 러시아를 재통합하는 것이야말로 혐오스러운 배신자라는 그의 비참한 별명을 없애주는 유일한 길이라 믿는 나약하고 고립된 인물이 되어 버렸다."

 SAM_MILETIY_ZYKOV_DESC:0 "It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov has been the heart and the conscience of the Russian Liberation Movement - if one can call such a scattered congregation of Vlasovite generals and civilian figures that was assembled under the auspices of the Nazi invaders a 'movement'. Recognized for his talent as a propagandist, Zykov was the person who shaped the ideology of the Russian Liberation Army and put forward the democratic ideals that proved to be so important in the struggle against the Soviet tyranny. Even if those ideals were obscured by the necessities of war, Zykov consistently espoused his support for renewed Russian democracy and provided much-needed legitimacy to the otherwise doomed cause of serving the occupants and the occupied alike.\n\nThe past and true motives of Zykov remain an unresolvable enigma even to his colleagues. His contradictory, often nonsensical comments about himself only further widen the web of rumors that has enveloped his background. Claiming to be a former adjutant of Nikolai Bukharin and supporter of the Marxist thought, Zykov prefers to imagine himself as an adherent of Russian republicanism who saw the inevitable failure of Bolshevism. Meanwhile, his numerous opponents within the KONR depict Zykov as a dishonest opportunist, a lowly Bolshevik Jewish writer who defected to the ROA only to save his skin and has since capitalized on a populist appeal and an idealistic facade to expand his personal influence.\n\nBeing one of the closest people to Andrey Vlasov and one of his most avid supporters, Zykov achieved the favor of the old General to pursue his own bid for power in the ROA after Vlasov's death. Whenever his beliefs lie, he now has to trial them between the hammer of the old guard resisting his seditious rhetoric and the anvil of his share and burden as a traitor."

 SAM_SERGEY_BUNYACHENKO_DESC:0 "Few men have contributed as much to the success of the Russian Liberation Army as much as Sergey Kuzmich Bunyachenko. A soldier of the Red Army since the age of 16, he saw combat in more fronts and battles than most, both in the Russian Civil War and in the Second World War. He would be a leading commander in the Caucasus, yet would find difficulty in turning the tide of war. Back at home, Bukharin's regime found him as a perfect scapegoat to blame the failures of the Red Army on, even if he was not the one to blame for the complete failure of the Soviet Union to defend itself. Soon, though, during a brave counter-attack, his division would be encircled and he would be captured.\n\nBunyachenko would remain in a penal colony separated from society until the infamous West Russian War. That was when he would request from the government he was at the mercy of to join in the fight against the WRRF and avenge the communists, who he harbored so much hatred for. He would fight bravely on the side of Vlasov and the Russian Liberation Army, until the ROA coalesced into its own warlord state in Samara. There, he would play a key role in governing the region and raising a proper military. This would eventually earn him a high position in the government, becoming Minister of Defense.\n\nWith the death of Vlasov, Bunyachenko has managed to rise to power in Samara. A militarist, Bunyachenko will not stop until the communists, and perhaps the Germans to the west as well, are dealt with. As the head of the KONR, he is glad to use it as long as it serves its interests. However, should he deem the committee to be an ineffective organ, Bunyachenko might have no problem with assuming control."

 SAM_VIKTOR_MALTSEV_DESC:0 "Viktor Ivanovich Maltsev is a man who held some semblance of ideals once, serving in the ROA as the Chief of the Air Force during the West Russian War and the aftermath. Witnessing the chaos of post-war Russia changed that, and the torture the NKVD inflicted on him during the war turned him very bitter, and scraped off anything resembling an ideological thought on him. He saw a shattered Russia as a confirmation of the failures of democracy, socialism, and Empire; he looks beyond the borders of liberalism and rights to find himself in possession of a new, tested solution.\n\nThe Germans are not enemies, but allies, in his view. How could his experiences in the past war speak against that? He follows and copies every move the Germans make, seeing them as a people that have cleansed out of them the desire for freedom and civility. Though the Germans may vary in their view of him, he is one of the most loyal collaborators in the ranks of the ROA. He finds his ends as theirs and vice-versa, stopping at nothing to enact them. Whatever Russia he had imagined and fought for, a sheer lust of power has consumed it, replacing a Russian nationalist with a man hell-bent on ruling anyone and everything.\n\nHe shed no tears at Vlasov's death. He detested the man; Vlasov was weak, Vlasov was too indecisive. On the contrary, he welcomed it as a divine act. Now Samara is Maltsev, and Maltsev is Samara. His political link to Moskowien will ensure continued aid, and over his lands fall a deep and dark shadow. God has willed Maltsev as the Helmsman; whether or not this is true, remains to be seen."
 
 SAM_MIKHAIL_OKTAN_DESC:0 "Charitably described as a 'complete bastard', Mikhail Alexandrovich Ilinich's ascendancy to the position of Chairman of the KONR marks the beginning of a new and dark chapter in Russia's story. Known by his pseudonym Oktan, he's cynical, manipulative and professing a slavish loyalty to the Reich, it is no surprise that he found his calling in managing the unruly Russians on behalf of his masters - first as a newspaper editor and self-proclaimed governor, then as chief propagandist of the KONR. Under his supervision, propaganda efforts after the West Russian War were ramped up tenfold, reeling in thousands of fervently anti-Bolshevik followers while driving out those loyal to a feeble, 'free' vision of Russia.\n\nFew would have foreseen his sudden rise to power, however. Once, Oktan was known as little more than a vicious, treasonous, anti-semitic drunk. Even in the early days, Oktan despised Vlasov for his softness and lack of radicalism, alienating the would-be dictator from his colleagues. His snivelling appeasement of the Germans and desperation to enter the ranks of the Russian Liberation Army's leadership ensured that when he finally began to climb the ranks, he faced staunch opposition from the camps of Zykov and Bunyachenko. His rivals spared no effort informing the people of his cowardice, laziness and lecherous conduct, but that effort came to naught.\n\nNow, they say nothing. Those who dare to whisper of Oktan's disloyalty to the Smolensk Declaration and the principles of the KONR soon find themselves arrested to face 're-education' - or worse. Having learned much from his past friendship with the Gestapo, Oktan has proven merciless and brutal in the suppression of his opposition and unwillingness to compromise on anything that might jeopardize his absolute rule. As a man who once enjoyed the full confidence of the Germans, there is no telling what horrors Oktan's rule might have in store for the people of Russia."

 POLITICS_VIKTOR_POLYAKOV_DESC:0 "Much like his colleague to the northwest, Viktor Nikolayevich Polyakov was a simple factory director before power was thrust upon him. Born in Siberia, he found himself in the right - or wrong - spot at the right time to be sent as an industrial advisor of a rapidly collapsing WRRF to the city of Samara on the banks of the Volga, and for the next few years, that was where he operated. Polyakov rose fast in the vehicle industry, even competing against Katushev in the same market.\n\nIn the end, that profession was what made him well known in the city, and when the time came, got him elected as the leader of the local People's Assembly and mayor of Samara. Polyakov now balances a life of economics and governing a primitive and fragile democracy in accord with North Russia's wishes.\n\nWhile ruling as a warlord can be hard for someone with little experience in that regard, Polyakov knows to turn to the fellow magnate in Nizhny Novgorod when things really get tough."

 SAM_german_bootlickers:0 "독일의 개"
 SAM_german_bootlickers_desc:0 "As much as we like to claim that we are a spearhead for the Liberation of Russia from under the Red Yoke of Bolshevism, everybody considers us an extension of German influence over the Motherland, and correspondingly hate us for it. Unfortunately, hatred by the Russian people does not correspond to love from our former German masters, who have written us off as mutinous rabble."
 SAM_The_Smolensk_Manifesto:0 "스몰렌스크 선언"
 SAM_The_Smolensk_Manifesto_desc:0 "Proof of the ROA's legitimacy to a select few, and a proof of their irredeemable treachery for all else. The Manifesto was issued during the West Russian War, declaring the ROA's opposition to communism in Russia and hopes for a new republic to replace the Soviet Union. Despite its creation by the hands of desperate German propagandists, the manifesto has remained a core component of our claim to legitimacy."

 SAM_German_Military_Training:0 "독일식 군사 훈련"
 SAM_German_Military_Training_desc:0 "Back when the ROA was a mere colonial militia, the Germans insisted on imposing military training and savage discipline onto their subhuman auxiliaries. The West Russian War saw the army's numbers swell with former Red Army veterans, and their mettle tested in desperate battles. As such, the ROA is one of the few professional militaries in Western Russia."
 SAM_Turncoat_General:0 "Turncoat General"
 SAM_Turncoat_General_desc:0 "Our generals and officers share little in common beyond their past as Germans prisoners of war and a willingness to work with the Germans. Some were driven by a hatred of the Red Army or anger at bad treatment, real or imagined. Others simply saw it as the way out of a prisoner's camp. No matter the reason, and no matter how skilled they are, our generals' treason to the Russian people make them widely detested men."

Accepting more German weapons is also not a good plan, as our soldiers must be seen and known as liberators of Russia, instead of mere German puppets. Thus, the best, and hardest path according to Zykov is to make do with what we have. This will leave us weaker in the short term.

Without much native industry and with limited import capacities, our fleet of trucks and armored vehicles melts by the day.\n\nOur men have been sent to scour the countryside for anything that might roll downhill. Tractors that peasants have given up on, military cars and trucks that have been abandoned in the wood, whatever broken down German or Soviet tank hidden in marshes or forests. This iron harvest will be a meager one, and most of what we find will likely be useless. But any quantity of engine blocks and armor plate we can scrounge up will be useful for the cause."

Whatever we can use is stashed away. Among the rest, whatever has a monetary value is hauled to convoys headed for the Moskowien border, where black market traders will give us a fraction of its price for our trouble. Selling abandoned cuckoo clocks and teapots will not make us rich men, but anything we can trade on the black market for supplies will still prove to be of value.\n\nTo cheer up the soldiers, fifteen percent of every discovery's value Is given to the men directly to encourage them to search.

The citizens must be better integrated into our governmental structure, to enable them to give their fair shake. They've had the luck of being among the first to be liberated by the KONR, and they should be aware of this.\n\nBunyachenko's plan is thus to organize a detailed census. Once the population of every village and community is known to us, we can begin estimating how closely the sheep can be shorn without injuring them.

Their time has been centered in the workshop where guns and ammo are manufactured. Others have cleared new plot of land to grow food for soldiers on. A few have just been drafted as reservists, and given a little food for their troubles.\n\nAs they want to, many complain about the rise in taxes.

But even the most skeptical has to admit that the newly reinvigorated army is doing more than ever to earn its pay, increased as it may be. Patrols on the road are more frequent. Bandit operations are increasingly seeing crackdowns. A cynical man might say this is to eliminate competition to our tax collectors. But everyone admits that Samara has never been a safer place.

Why bother to scavenge for rusted Soviet firearms and moldy turnips covered in cow shit while Samara's useless peasants hide their bounty underground? The KONR is blessed with access to the greatest military superpower the world has ever seen. Why not make use of it? Every shipment of quality German arms and supplies is another advantage that the Liberation Army cannot go without.\n\nOktan's proposal has gained quite a bit of support beyond his own limited circle. For some Zykovites, getting weapons and supplies from the Germans means avoiding further taxation on the people. For some of Bunyachenko's faction, the prospect of new ammunition for their German weapon supply is very attractive indeed. However, those not in favor of the plan argue from many angles, that depending on the Germans is a bad plan in the long run, and that continually begging for equipment is unsightly. In the background, the German advisors observe the unfolding debate."

But rapid delivery and quantity of shipped equipment is perhaps the only thing that can be said about the German aid.\n\nSoldiers have spent days unpacking crates after crates of world war two era Kar98k rifles and 7.92x57mm Mauser ammunition. The Germans have supplemented their generous supply of antiquated weaponry and ammunition with stale rations. Optimists argue that they're from the West Russian War, and are still edible. Pessimists claim they're left over from world war two.\n\nOktan and his supporters do not seem to mind this. Food is food, and weapons are weapons. An army wins or dies based on discipline and leadership, and KONR has both in spades... or at least it would, if not for the whining and negative attitude of its current officer corp.

Of course, the German government is often busy, and so it is time for us to talk to other German friends.\n\nAcross the border lies Reichskommissariat Moskowien, the vast German administration built to administer Russia west of the AA line. Its hardscrabble population of settlers, military garrisons and Russian second class citizens try to make a living in the shadow of the warlords and bandits that lurk beyond the border. Over the year, members of the KONR such as Oktan have built up contact with citizen's militias and military officers of Moskowien. In exchange for help and support to Samara's government, the KONR has done its best to monitor its section of the border. Now that the German bombing campaign might be coming to an end, why not ring up our associates beyond the border and request more supplies, lest hordes of bolshevik anarchists and bandits pour over our border?"

Many citizens, especially among the left leaning, see us as unrepentant traitors that have contributed to the failure of the WRRF.\n\nOpinion among the officer corp as to the best solution run the usual gamut of proposals.

While it is out of the question to punish our soldiers too harshly - lest we lose control of the state - ensuring that the worst excesses are penalized and that aggrieved citizens are compensated goes a long way. Another idea that is slowly gaining traction are mixed military-civilian community councils, where small garrisons see their organization enmeshed with the village they protect. It will be a long process, but getting the people to support and back our cause now has a good chance of actually happening."

Living on the edge of starvation is the sad normal in the Russian Anarchy, and simply keeping our people well fed will generate generous amount of positive apathy. While Zykov is not wrong that the population needs to cooperate with our liberation project, it's not worth investing that much effort into improving their life.

While this is understandable, many have subtly made clear that all it would take would be some cash to slicken the wheels of local bureaucracy. To do this would make twofold: create a class of politicians at least outwardly loyal to us, and prevent any attempt by them to support an insurrection of former Vologdan politicians.\n\nWhile morally turpitudinous and not very loyal to our noble beliefs, many believe that it is more than necessary, and an attempt to persuade them otherwise or even replace them would prove more costly than a small portion of out treasury going unaccounted for."

They shall all become loyal to their new overlords, whether that is through education, propaganda, pressure or violence.

For that reason, Chairman Vlasov has proposed a plan that will allow them to both rebuild and gain their loyalty to Samara. Should it succeed, the problems presented to us by the north will end.\n\nFirstly, communities in Tatarstan shall be generously provided funds and subsidies, which will be used for many purposes. That can be rebuilding the towns ravaged by the endless German bombings, or creating new buildings and factories.

To combat this problem that could hamper our efforts in conquering the city, the Russian Liberation Army must be prepared for this style of combat. Anti-tank equipment shall be built in our factories and distributed to our troops, while the soldiers will be trained in tactics against armoured forces through regular military exercises.

They shall be granted territory to live, cultivate, and make a profit out of, while helping keep tight control over it.

For that reason, he must be held accountable for his crimes against the people of Russia: a trial will be held, for our courts to decide what the fate of this man shall be.

As they are nothing but a hurdle in our struggle to unify a country torn apart by war and chaos, they must be invaded and crushed at all costs.\n\nFor that reason, the experienced army of Samara must prepare for a full invasion of the territories under Ivanov's army.

It is to give the land to them.\n\nThe government will distribute these unstable yet fertile and rich lands to officers and generals of the army, who will be responsible for pacifying these areas by force and will have some profit out of them. With this approach, everyone will be satisfied: our government will stabilize these territories, our army will be earning profit and have their own land to grow and settle, and the people there will live without fearing of instability, raids and attacks.

Whether that is the syncretists of the Mladorossi movement, the theocrats of Gayny, the Bashkir nationalists or anyone else, these forces will all have to be defeated and subjugated to ensure we have better chances against the WRRF.

Still, no matter what those Islamist fanatics may think, Bashkiria is nothing more than an integral part of the Russian state, and the ethnic Russians living there must be liberated from their oppression.

Being mad at the state of Russia, they coalesced around a leader, Grandmaster Mikhail, and formed their own warlord state.\n\nNow, we could use the fact they are supporters of the old order and Christianity to gain their support against the godless communists we are trying to defeat.

Every Tsar further weakened Russia, only for it to fall under the communist jackboot in 1917.

With less spent on unnecessary bureaucratic expenditures, we can focus on new projects, from roads, to industry, to radar defences.\n\nWe have seen the results of a strong bureaucracy; that is a nation that slowly strangles itself from the inside.

We will provide to them funding, laborers, areas to open new factories, and lucrative deals that will encourage them to produce for us.

If we wish to see our flag fly from the capital of a free Russia, the first step is modernizing our army.\n\nWe shall contract out to various Samaran automobile factories orders of hundreds of trucks and jeeps to equip our many infantry divisions for the fight that is surely soon to come. By contracting to multiple factories we can hope that they will compete to create more efficient vehicles, and the one that shows it can produce motorized equipment at the highest capacity and quality will receive the most funding from the Samaran government.

Although he rules his own fiefdom out of the city of Berezniki, Kazembek pledged allegiance to the now dealt-with Tsar in Vyatka, who was decidedly less enthusiastic about their relationship.\n\nThe Young Russians are weak and without their benefactors in Vyatka, making the invasion of Berezniki a simple task.

This will not suffice in our future battles; the enemies we have ahead of us will be larger, better-equipped, and more industrially formidable than our comparably meager previous foes.\n\nThe prospect of a serious disparity in equipment quality between us and our rivals is disconcerting enough to warrant immediate action.

Our ground superiority allowed us to bulldoze our way through Russia, but this tactical state of affairs will not last. Our future opponents will be larger, more modern states, easily capable of fielding jet fighters and bombers.\n\nThe ROA needs to react with the utmost speed to these changing circumstances and create a new air force.

It is hard to make a profit when your potential customers are fighting for their lives and focused on not starving. But now that we have restored a measure of stability to our corner of Russia we may be able to attract some investment from overseas. Corporations from Italy, America, and Japan might be persuaded to at least look into expanding their operations into Russia. The promise of a government that is friendly to capitalism and eager to establish economic ties with the outside world just might be enough to get them to overlook the dangers of investing in an ongoing warzone."

In the west, our industrial program has created a lot of winners and a lot of losers. Many agitate for further labor rights. Many of those agitating are useful idiots for communist remnants of the WRRF.\n\nWe must be vigilant, and monitor dissenting groups. The Republic must stand strong."

Steel and energy production are skyrocketing; advanced goods such as military hardware and consumer electronics are beginning to roll out of the Kombinats' factories at ever greater speed.\n\nTo keep this momentum, the growing Kombinats must continue to expand, and establish themselves in the eastern territories. Ressources there are endless; local businessmen underestimate the cunning and rapacity of our industrial collosi. By maintaining a carefully managed pool of great corporations, we can reap the benefits of centralised economic might with free market induced competition and evolution."

A loud but persistent minority of our citizens are likely to agree with this assessment, decrying our current economic miracle as exploitative and unjust.\n\nTo rectify this, our government shall engage in a calculated bout of "useful splendor".

Already the German empire decays, whereas communism endures across the world.\n\nWe must help convey this to all of the nation's population. The Reds' inability to defeat the Reich and restore stability to Russia was by far the greatest menace to our people's future. President Bunyachenko, aided by his wise advisors, is an epoch making man. An economic and industrial boom the like of which has only been seen so far in Manchuria is in the making, a veritable ecosystem of steel and progress wrought into existence through the Russian man's hard work. Our President has made this possible, and the ROA will make sure that the envious Germans are not able to violently bring it all down. Some may call this a propaganda campaign.

This came crashing down when piles of bad debts destroyed the Yasuda zaibatsu and started the Japanese Economic Wars.\n\nTo avoid this fate we can use our central bank as a tool of defence. Every Kombinat will be forced to keep a certain amount of cash on hand, and keep an up to date plan to deal with a market downturn. Every year or so, agents of our government will be allowed to announce a surprise inspection, to verify the stability of each firm's finances. People trying to fudge numbers will be dealt with severely.\n\nThere will be no hubris here. We've come too far to let mere greed upset the stability of Russian recovery.

Nevertheless, many of these businesses in the eastern provinces are run by people with ties to opposition groups, or by personnel with little interest in our glorious national rejuvenation.

Even in these desperate times, few could stomach working directly for the traitor general himself. Those that managed to either ignore or muster indifference towards the accusations against Vlasov found themselves buried in drudgery: bored out of their wits instead of merely disgusted by the stench of treason. Better, perhaps, to pray for an assignment on the border instead where death and starvation dispelled the lethargy.\n\nVlasov stood on political quicksand, his position shifting and changing by the day but never improving. Some of his aides suspected that the old man would have preferred being genuinely hated by his generals instead of their current indifference. In the college of traitors that filled the ROA's upper echelon, Vlasov was not particularly liked, but nor was he disliked. Whatever coalition or common ground he tried to build usually disintegrated within the month.\n\nBut if the old general could not be liked by everyone, he could at least try to gin up love and hatred within specific factions. Under him Zykov's democrats constantly agitated against Oktan's war profiteers. In between, schemed the officer's committee, General Bunyachenko their puppet.\n\nVlasov had long pondered on which factions to cast his full and hollow weight behind. His remaining scraps of authority would tip the balance. Now that the time for a decision had come, the general's own aide could scarcely guess which side Vlasov would choose, nor how the ROA's future would play out as a result."

While not officially on the officer's committee, Milety Zykov had wormed his way into a comfortable office in Samara's principal headquarters. Supporters of his faction could be seen streaming in and out at various times. A few stacks of pamphlets rested on the office's varied furniture.\n\nZykov almost yanked the package from the aide's hands after his swift introduction and began leafing through it, whistling all the while. "Interesting...interesting," were the propagandist's only comments. For his trouble, Vlasov's aide was given a new package. "Bring it to your boss, alright?" Zykov said, with characteristic cheer. Moments later, the aide found himself escorted back outside. The stream of visitors had brought even more officers to the corridor, all waiting for a chance to speak with Zykov.\n\nNone of them appeared too surprised to see one of Vlasov's own aides coming out of the office, expecting the commander to keep in touch with his own prime propagandist.

The room was austere, with no luxury other than a small furnace in one corner. The aide waited as the general read through a few of the sets of documents.

Fresh arrival from our western neighbor."\n\nThe aide glanced at the box of expertly rolled cigarettes. It had been so long since he'd last had a proper smoke. The thought of owing something to Oktan, however, no matter how insignificant, gave the aide some pause. Still, good tobacco was good tobacco. "Thank you, commander."\n\nThe aide placed on Oktan's desk the package he had been tasked to bring, and then helped himself to a few cigarettes. Oktan smiled.\n\n"I've heard good things about you, soldier. If you ever find yourself looking to carry out a couple of favours, please come visit me. I've no greater concern than my men's quality of life,"\n\nA tempting offer for sure. The aide nodded again to Oktan and followed the guards back outside. One of them offered him a light.

Outside his relatives wailed as men of the ROA dragged out the unconscious body. The poor bastard was placed on a cart, his family given a few bags of food to help cushion the loss of a working age man.\n\nThe garrison's captain reviewed his troops as they continued digging out the pantry and salvaging as much of the food as possible. One recruit, a young lad from the nearby villages, looked particularly grim as he shovelled bits of concrete out into the yard.\n\n"Why the long face, soldier?

"Sir, ah, hmm."\n\n"Speak"\n\n"It's just, uh, sir, the men of the village, they said that the ROA had a deal with the Germans, uh, sir. That their bases were not bombed."\n\nThe officer laughed. "Is this what they say in whatever shithole we dragged you out of? That the Germans have an ounce of mercy? That they give a shit about their old conscript army?"\n\n"Uh, yes, sir!"\n\n"Well, there's your answer." The officer gestured toward the collapsed building where the other soldiers were pretending to work. "There's the answer for all of you. The ROA's got nothing but what we can get ourselves.

 SAM.6.d:0 "The young officer's speech had been short and crisp.

"Yes." the young man agreed, it would be unfair for the ROA's commanders and soldiers to weather even more deprivation. It would be easier to take from the peasants, or to kowtow to the Germans for supplies. Every man with a gun west of moskowien had found himself doing either of those things at some point and besides, they were already known as bootlickers and collaborators! What would they lose by forsaking the last shreds of honour and goodwill they still had?\n\nNo. The men of the Army of National Liberation should and could be better than that. Each increase in taxation bled away at the army's dwindling popular support. This situation could not go forward. As to German weapons, what of them? Military surplus that had been used to massacre the motherland's children, given to them kindly by the twentieth century's greatest criminals. The ROA would do better.\n\nThe words of the Zykovite faction had been idealistic, yes. Naive, perhaps. But they stood out from the hopeless pragmatism of Bunyachenko's faction, and from Oktan's weary and greed-fueled cynicism. The officers voted for Ivanovich's proposed austerity, under the watchful eye of enlisted men."

 SAM.7.t:0 "No Protection without Taxation"
 SAM.7.d:0 "General Bunyachenko had not risen to his current position of mouthpiece for the stratocracy clique for nothing. Today, the general's simple logic and well structured argumentation had carried the day and won a majority of the officer corp's votes. After all, "How can the people of Samara expect the proud men of the ROA to defend them and maintain peace without food and supplies?"\n\nGeneral Bunyachenko's handlers within the officer corp could be seen nodding and whispering to one another as the resolution to increase taxation had passed. Word on the street had the dominant officer clique fear losing the vote to Oktan or Zykov's factions. The current system of a strictly defined hierarchy and of equality within the same rank of officers worked well. The conservative officers feared that Oktan's small group of profiteers and smugglers or Zykov's assembly of democrats would destroy the ROA's professionalism.\n\nThe tax harvest would bring in a considerable amount of supplies, and demonstrate to the common soldier that the current system worked well. Perhaps General Vlasov would take notes when looking for a successor... or a group of successors?"
 SAM.7.a:0 "The officer corps knows best how to lead the ROA."
 
 SAM.8.t:0 "The German Connection"
 SAM.8.d:0 "After a heated debate, Oktan's proposal served as a good compromise. There would be no austerity for the troops and officers. Nor would the supplies be taken at gun points from terrified civilians. Requests would be put in through both official and unofficial channels for more German supplies. Ammunition, rifles, clothes, food, whatever the Reich deigned to give or sell to the ROA. Pragmatists in RK Moskowien had long accepted that having part of the long frontier with the Russian Anarchy be controlled by something other than bandits or Russian revanchist was worth its weight in gold.\n\nOf course, Oktan had to explain a share of questions and accusations from skeptical officers. Complaints that relying on official German shipments would undermine the ROA's reputation were defty addressed. Those inclined to hate the Army of National Liberation would continue to do so, while neutral Russian citizens could dismiss these rumors. Others accused Oktan of simply trying to score a big contraband take. To this the general smiled and patiently explained that his network of contracts would make the whole operation possible, and that every shipment could be audited by an independent commission if needed.\n\nIn the end the objections would not sink down the idea. It was too good a way for the conservative officers and the Zykovites to save face. Even allowing Oktan a little profiteering was deemed an acceptable price."

 SAM.10.d:0 "The men of the village sat somber in their church, wearing the least filthy and least bloodied - though still noticeably so - of their holiday attires. Chairs had been gathered in a rough circle, centered on the strange man from Samara. Leaning against the walls was an array of soldiers, their weapons dangling casually from rifle slings.\n\n"Friends and brothers! You've been called to this meeting to help assist the Army of Russian Liberation! It has always been our hope to bring freedom and democracy to the lands under our control. Today, we come to hear from you and your kin. What are some issues you'd like to see addressed? How we hope to improve your lives, citizens?"\n\nAn embarrassed silence. Someone raises their hand halfway, before reconsidering. Not fast enough for the indefatigable friend of the people. Zykov pointed to the man."You, my friend, you have something on your mind?"\n\n"It's just, ah, sir, the soldiers come around for taxes, but it's never the same amount. I thought, uh, that we'd like to know in advance how much they need. S-so we can be prepared to hand it out to them, Sire." Zykov nodded at this. Encouraged, a few others brought up complaints, always respectfully to the soldiers of the room. Long dormant ruins that occupied their fields, bombing raids that left a good half of the village's people homeless, mines and half-awake bombs that detonated in the night...Little by little, a picture emerged of the myriad of problems affecting this here village out in the middle of nowhere. The ROA's chief propagandist would put this information to good use, a few patrols should see to their needs sufficiently... And hoped that the villagers would remember their benefactor in return."

 SAM.11.d:0 "The ROA's men usually left their garrison in force once a month to gather whatever resources and meager crops that counted towards taxation. Other times, inhabitants of the region could be forgiven for forgetting the existence of the so-called army of liberation. There were few bandits in the area, and so the ROA's did not bother with much more than token patrols.\n\nToday, unusually, the soldiers were marching out and about. From the garrison depot on their convoy snaked through to the small hamlets, horses and men weighed down with cargo. As it turned out, the ROA's new policy of redistribution had begun.\n\nVillages in areas generally deficient in food were given rations and grain. Communities that had lost men and workers to bombing, drafting or injuries were compensated with dozens of work hours from the local garrison. In a few places, it was gleefully reported, astonished kids received candies from the quartermasters.\n\nThis calculated generosity impressed the weary villagers in its cynicism. With the new hand-outs, life would be tolerable, instead of a grinding wait before certain starvation. In the meantime however, men and women would hopefully be too busy eating to listen to anti-ROA agitators."

 SAM.12.d:0 "Political prisoners were tossed in daily, captured from throughout Samara by Oktan's crackdown. In overcrowded common cells, men wallowed in filth and anger as they waited for the daily triage.\n\nEven dissidents plotting against the ROA were of use to Oktan's faction. Each prisoner would go through a battery of psychological tests and brutal examinations, before being sorted into one of three groups. Those judged too dangerous or that would never comply to orders were executed. The next group was filled with men who despised the ROA but who were too docile to stir up trouble by themselves. These men were escorted to various work camps, where their labor would help maintain the state that kept their families safe. Of course, the laborers would be paid and fed. Good behavior might even see some of this hard earned money trickle back to their families.\n\nFinally, there were those that would do anything to earn their freedom. Joining communist or bandit groups had been for them a tremendous lapse of judgement. These men paid a punitive fine to the ROA, and were allowed to walk free. Their path out of the prison took them in front of the holding cells, where angry men of their hometown could see who had bent the knee. Back home, the freed prisoners would only find work and safety through continued submission to the ROA.\n\nPolitical prisoners were tossed in daily, but at an ever slowing pace. The crackdown had been swift and merciless. Peace would return to Samara, its communities more silent than ever as working age men were taken away for triage."

Balashov was used to permissions being granted in muddy shitholes with terrible alcohol and even worse brothels.\n\nHis presence in Samara, however, would not be for R&R. With rumbles of a new set of wars in western Russia, almost every officer that could make the trip had been invited to give their say in a final leadership conference. The officers committee claimed every officers' opinion would be taken into account. The officers committee claimed a lot of things.\n\nThe most pressing topic was on everybody's lips. Who would succeed Vlasov as chairman. Balashov really did not care. He suspected few others did. Far from the little games played in Samara, the vast majority of the ROA spent most of its time patrolling, training, and keeping an eye out on the locals. None of them knew what the future would bring. Making such plans was the hobby of Samara's elite clique.\n\nBalashov had been twenty two when the Germans drafted him. Twenty five when they had forced him at gunpoint to leave his fiancee and fight the communists. He was now thirty five, he had no idea what had become of his fiancee, his children. He had long since given up on returning home. Perhaps the candidates to succeed Vlasov might convince him to keep hope again."
 SAM.13.a:0 "Most likely not."
 
 SAM.14.t:0 "A Kindred Spirit"
 SAM.14.d:0 "In theory the day's topic was merely about the best way to administer newly liberated areas. A young captain had made a passionate speech about collaboration and partnership with the local civilians. The next officer to speak was commander Bunyachenko, the usual mouthpiece of the upper echelon of the officers' committee. Balashov was less interested in Bunyachenko's speech than in the man himself. After all the general's arguments were the usual rhetoric about the dangers of giving too much power to the masses; it was a fine refutation delivered with the general's hint of an Ukrainian accent. No, Balashov was more interested in the officers' committee's mouthpiece than in his message.\n\nBunyachenko's grim expression reminded Balashov of his and his men's. An unhappy determination, a decade of sorrows and losses. The only time the general's eyes lit up was when he mentioned the hated communists and Germans that had stolen their future. Commander Bunyachenko was a hard man and one whom Balashov would gladly follow in battle. The only mystery left unresolved in Balashov's mind was about Bunyachenko's dreams. Would such a man remain the officers' committee's puppet like Vlasov had become? Or would he use his status as chairman to be something more?"
 SAM.14.a:0 "Perhaps there's still some life in him."
 
 SAM.15.t:0 "Chasing the Setting Sun"
 SAM.15.d:0 "The day's conferences had ended. Balashov and a few other officers from his district had settled on a local bar to get refreshments after a day of talking. Like most of the city of Samara for the congress, the establishment was filled to the brim with men of the ROA.\n\nIn one corner Balashov recognized one of the Zykovite democracy proponents that had given an impassioned speech. The speaker waved Balashov and his friends over, offering them seats next to his own group of officers. Without much thought Balashov headed toward the chair, signalling to the barman for a drink. Why not spend the evening with the Zykovites, why not?\n\nIn person the pro-democracy speaker was much more personable than Balashov had expected. A colonel from the border region with the Orenburg communes, the man was an old hand of the West Russian War. Conversations drifted from topic to topic. Memories of the desperate struggle against the WRRF. The famous operation to secure the south eastern territories from bandits in the aftermath of the Front's collapse. If the Colonel's assignment was in the quiet south east sector, it was because he had helped make it quiet.\n\n"So, what's an old hand like you doing with Zykov and his jumped up peasants turned junior officer? Don't you have better things to do than help that fool?" One of Balashov's comrades asked, his tongue loosened by drink. The colonel's drinking friends flashed grimaces, but the colonel himself shrugged. "When we crushed the bandits, the locals in the south east were grateful. After decades of pointless struggle in the Red Army, then the ROA, it felt nice, you know? Fighting for something. Zykov's a strange man, but he's one with a plan. Like me, he dreams of going west. Freeing Moskowien. I don't know if my home town will ever welcome me back. But if I can get buried next to my ancestors, that's one thing the Germans won't have taken from me."

Most of the others discussed their most recent acquisition from the capital. Booze, tobacco, a few odds and ends. One of the lieutenants showed off his new toy, a sleek Walter PPK pistol to replace the aging P38 pistol he had been given upon recruitment into the ROA.\n\nMany of the men in the truck had a significantly better haul than their meagre salary should have allowed. Balashov thought of the friendly officers in the capitals, associate of commander Oktan. The trade with Moskowien was an entire organization all of its own, and its members were some of the richest and most generous of the ROA.\n\nAt the leadership conference they too had argued for their boss as successor to Vlasov. They railed against Zykov's foolish idealism, and against Bunyachenko's lethargic puppeteers in the officer's committee. The ROA was strong. Should it not have a strong leader? One able to provide for the soldiers and officers? One able to enforce discipline, order and progress throughout Russia? At least, so Oktan's proxies had talked during the conference. They had talked and they had given out much goodies. It paid to be friendly with men that held so many... contacts. Balashov had not taken anything from these men yet. But the option remained on his mind..."

 SAM.17.d:0 "Today, Andrey Vlasov has reluctantly made what will in time be known as "Vlasov's Secret Speech" to his most senior and long-standing officers of the ROA, announcing his successor. It's been a well-known, if unspoken, fact that the aging chairman has not been in good temperament recently, and many have long expected this day to come.\n\nOne of Vlasov's aides attended him as he prepared his final speech, announcing the chairman's successor within the hour. He was expected by the officer committee fifteen minutes ago for a standard meeting before the announcement, but he hadn't bothered attending. The aide, one of the few allowed into the chairman's room, silently observed the old marshal. His brow was furrowed, and despite the rather chilly temperatures of the office, it seemed that his face glistened with sweat. He was intensely staring at the script, scribbled by hand onto a piece of paper - not reading it or editing it, just staring. The aide checked his watch. "Sir, I-" he tried to hurry the marshall along, well-familiar with the punishment he may receive for Vlasov being late of his own accord. Vlasov however put up a hand as soon as the aide spoke, silently terminating the aide's hope to get things moving. The marshal stood up, slowly, and delicately folded the piece of paper up into his pocket. "Shall we?" he asked the aide. "Yes, sir." the aide responded.\n\nThe old marshal stood in front of his officers, some of them having been with him since the earliest days of the ROA. He looked at all of them - seeing familiar faces, but, for the first time, more than a few faces that he didn't recognize. Could they be new? Vlasov asked himself, the silence in the room deadening as all looked to him and waited. Or had he simply forgotten who they were? Sighing, Vlasov looked down at his paper, and spoke at last:\n\n"As you all know, I am not getting any younger. It has time for me to announce a formal successor to the Russian Liberation Army's Chairman position. And for this, I have chosen...""

 SAM.18.d:0 "Miletiy Zykov and a number of his more prominent allies sat in one of the many formal conference rooms common to the governmental buildings that dotted Samara. Now that he had begun to grab a hold on the reins of power, he knew that he had to address one of the two elephants in the crowded metaphorical room - Sergey Bunyachenko. The mouthpiece for the officers. Bunyachenko had been one of Vlasov's competing successors, meaning that he held enough clout and influence to pose a real threat to Zykov's plans, if he so wished. They had scheduled an impromptu meeting with the general, and he was running late.\n\nThe doors creaked open as Bunyachenko ungracefully stepped through. His uniform was dishevelled and his eyes were bloodshot. It looked as if he had been drinking, at the very least just last night, if not into this morning as well. "Good morning, I apologize for my tardiness", Bunyachenko started. "I had lost track of time while I-"\n\nZykov interrupted. "It doesn't matter! We've called you here because we want to discuss your future with the Russian Liberation Army." Bunyachenko's eyes widened. "Don't worry, we're not having you shot."One of the officers chimed in.\n\nZykov glanced at his peer dismissively, before turning to Bunyachenko once more. "No, I suppose we aren't. You represent something that is of value to me, Sergey." Zykov asserted. "You have the ear of the people we need to hear, and who need to be heard by us. The way I see it... we'll keep you around, with a generous salary, and not only will you remain at the head of our armed forces, but you will also report directly to us about any goings on in the army that would need to be reported on. Does that make sense?" A short, curt nod from the general followed, and he was dismissed."

 SAM.19.d:0 ""We all know who he is," Zykov began. "And we all know who's in his pocket."\n\nIt was true. Now that Zykov had assumed control of the Russian Liberation Army, he had real reason to suspect that Mikhail Oktan, a well-known corrupt officer and a reveller in the less-than-savory operations undertaken by some of our soldiers, was one of the driving forces behind the instability following Zykov's ascent to power."But right now, acting against him would be disastrous. The web he's spun himself is far too wide; he controls too much." Zykov concluded, edging out any of his more hawkish supporters in their over-enthusiasm to deal with the individual.\n\n"But that's not to say, of course, that we should merrily leave him to prepare a coup. He operates on a system that centers around his ability to buy his supporters, which means that for a certain price, almost all of them can be bought back. I'd like to have a list drawn up of names that we can convince to come over to us... and a list of those who likely won't be bought, so that we can begin planning arrests of key figures. We may not be able to take him out, yet, but we can whittle him down. Does all of that make sense?"\n\nAides had been busily writing down the chairman's orders, but all nodded in unison as the chairman looked for their understanding.

But the problem was that he had a distinct lack of will to utilize that power: always concerned about maintaining the coalition above else, even at the expense of Samara and the people of Russia as a whole. Now, though, Zykov was the one in charge, at least for now. And he had more than utilized it.\n\nVlasov had many friends, and his enemies had many divisions. It was child's play, bouncing them back and forth using the bureaucracy, benefiting one at the expense of the other. And all the while, Zykov was promoting allies to the levers of power, the keys to a better future, both in the Committee and in government. Nothing big -- a secretary position here, a subdepartment headship here, all an intricately connected web of connections and friends that, when the time came, would remember who helped them and their families.\n\nAnd then there was the people, the broken, shattered remnants of a once great country. They hated the Committee, and rightly so. They were, after all, a bunch of German bootlickers - for now, at least. But they would learn, in time, to rely on them. The bare bones of a welfare state, with regular drops of food and protection and a general upgrade in a standard of living would keep them satisfied, especially after experiencing almost twenty years of deprivation.\n\nBut this was just the setting of the stage. The actors would be brought together, the probs created. All that remind was the script, with Zykov as the writer.\n\nAnd Zykov wanted to go faster."

You've summoned me?" Asked Zykov, sitting down. "That I have. I found myself reflecting on your successful campaign to become Deputy-Chairman. Chairman Vlasov has always spoken well of your ability to inspire and spread a message. These aptitudes will be needed in the coming wars of unification." Zykov frowned slightly, and spoke. "I'm afraid, Deputy-Chairman, that I will be unable to give my full support to the officer's committee and to your program. After all, the democratic ideals I fight for were rejected at the convention. What w-" Bunyachenko cut him off. "Forget idealism. Take a look around, what do you see? Tired men in the officer's committee, unwilling to recognize that half of their staff has been bribed by Oktan. Enemies all around us, plotting to hang us as traitors. Chairman Vlasov, too tired to intervene directly. I know you're not a fool, despite your reputation. I need your help to stave off chaos. There won't be a Russia to spread democracy to if the communists are sitting here next year."\n\nZykov thought for a moment. His eternally confident demeanor did irritate Bunyachenko slightly. Difficult to read what went on behind the man's cheerful mask. Finally Zykov offered his hand for Bunyachenko to shake. "I'll offer what I can. As we both know, I have my own interests, but I think these work out beautifully with yours, Deputy-Chairman." Bunyachenko shook the hand of his new chief propagandist.

But even if he hated it, he still had to deal with it, one way, or another. And who was better to clean up Marshal Vlasov's image as a German bootlicker than Zykov, the chief 'PR' man himself?\n\nIt was a test run at first, to see how far they could get with a little bit of glorification. Posters of Vlasov shown side by side with his men, inspecting them and generally being an attractive leader of the people. Then it expanded to constant radio bombardments of the 'real' history of Vlasov's supposed 'betrayal' - which was, according to those announcements, was in reality a last ditch effort to protect the Russian people. Then, when that was done, the minor financiation of a couple of cheap plays, depicting the Great Patriotic War, with Vlasov as the tragic hero of the War that broke Russia into a thousand pieces.\n\nThen, as the people began to think that, perhaps, just maybe, they had been wrong, it was time to bring out the tears: show the faces of the men whose families were in concentration camps, their broken, shattered faces being reminded of the horrible fate that awaited them at the death camps. Then make them stare at the camera or, in the most effective cases, have them say, with no hint of sarcasm or dislike, 'Vlasov was only trying to do what was best for me and my family.'\n\nIt was a good show, Bunyachenko admitted, especially considering how Zykov found an actor that could emote so well. A little saccharine, but Zykov knew how to play a crowd. Maybe by the end of the year, Vlasov would be as well loved as he was hated the year before."

Of course, part of this workload was caused by his ever dwindling staff.\n\nIt felt as if every other day began with a resignation, or its silent equivalent of the staffer simply not appearing for work. Those who had appeared in front of him to hand in their resignation had been gently questioned. Most insisted they were simply retiring from politics. One or two of the honest ones explained that deputy-chairman Oktan had offered a better deal. Land, money, positions of importance, it seemed that the good deputy-chairman never ran out of agreeable rewards for those who befriended him, thought Zykov.\n\nAll this was not good, but it was not extremely bad for the moment. In a way, it was a good thing to see those not entirely dedicated to the cause just up and leave. The remaining core of Zykov's organization would be more motivated than ever to see justice and democracy be restored to Russia. Oktan's constant war on the democratic faction (as well as on the officer's committee, Zykov suspected) would not go unacknowledged however. The former journalist sighed, and picked up the phone.

A proposal of diplomacy.\n\nAccording to them, before taking any hostile action against the Neutral State or the government in Vologda, we should first extend an offer of peaceful re-integration. Of effective surrender, from them to us. Though some officers dismissed the idea immediately, others have spoken of its inherent merits.\n\nSending such an offer would show, not only to other states but also to all the peoples of Russia, that we at least attempted peaceful actions before resorting to forcible ones. A perception that could be of significant assistance in the future. In addition, any such offer would also implicitly make a threat of subsequent invasion clear.\n\nHowever, it has been brought to our attention that such a course possesses significant inherent risk. Should the Neutral State prove resistant to our 'offer,' they would be made aware of a likely imminent invasion, and be given the opportunity to prepare defenses and other plans of their own.\n\nThere are merits and flaws to either course of action, but a decision must be made. What should be done?"

In essence, they are asking for our surrender, and threatening hostile action should we decline.\n\nMembers of our government are split. One one hand, several argue that the Neutral State does not possess the strength to resist such an invasion, and that agreeing to the proposal could not only save lives, but also perhaps allow us to secure certain protections or concessions in response. Despite reservations at extending trust to the collaborators, they argue it is the only reasonable option.\n\nOthers, however, disagree vehemently, calling it madness to trust such criminals, and that the only thing this 'offer' gives us is the opportunity to prepare for an invasion we now know is coming. That we now know is inevitable. This knowledge, they claim, could be enough to turn the tides in our favor in any conflict.\n\nRegardless, however, a response must be given. What should it be?"

It will prove that our word, long denigrated - and not without cause - as that of German collaborators, can be trusted. It will show that we have the moral capability to lead.\n\nBeyond that, however, it also offers us a large expansion of territory, many new resources, a large population pool to leverage for conscripts, and a better strategic position within our region, all properties that we intend to exploit to the fullest. The decision was a gambit, yes, and was much criticized among parts of the Army's officer corps, but it has paid off.\n\nWhile we cannot count on further bloodless victories in the times ahead, we can at least take pride in this one, and in the conservation of military strength that it promises."

But that is not the primary concern.\n\nTheir refusal has denied us the opportunity to prove that we are more than what we are seen to me. That we are no longer simply German collaborators. That we can give our word, that we can promise equitable and peaceful reunification, if permitted, and then follow through. And now we must, yet again, use force, and accept the repercussions of its use.\n\nSo be it. We will secure the lands of the Neutral State by military force, and incorporate its resources, its people, and its strategic position into our own, improving our ability to pursue further campaigns of regional unification.\n\nWe can only hope that this failure does not portend similar diplomatic failures in the future.

The ROA was in dire need of restructuring. Mikhael Oktan and his clique were a threat to Bunyachenko's new position and to the Committee as a whole. The man would need to be demoted.

If he did not take care then he could easily find himself dead in the night, with Oktan all too willing to take power.\n\nThere was another thorn in his side as well.

Such ideas had no place in the Russia he would rule, such as it was.\n\nWhile Vlasov still drew breath, he would need to tread carefully.

For now, he would need to be patient. Just as he had throughout the Great Patriotic War, the West Russian War, and the chaotic years that followed.\n\nHowever, that did not mean he could not act against his rivals. Vlasov had given him wide latitude for change within Samara and he intended to mold the ROA into a more preferable form. Now, he had a choice. He could risk the repercussions and move against Bunyachenko and Zykov immediately. It would come with risks but, at the same time, it could remove the biggest obstacles to his power right away.

His relentless drive to free Russia from the communist menace had been admired by many. In the dark days of the Western Russian Revolutionary war, areas liberated by the chairman's men had been spared the brutal retribution killing of the Wehrmacht. During the dark decade that followed, he had done as much as possible to shield the people of Samara from his former German backers.\n\nBut the mourners were far outnumbered by a mass of stone-faced civilians. Whether secretly angry or entirely apathetic, General Bunyachenko could not tell. He knew that an overwhelming majority of citizens thought Vlasov the lowest of lowest in all of Russian history. A pathetic dog of the German occupier, that had led Russian troops in a fratricidal war to crush the resurgent Red army. Soldiers with live ammunition had covered the funeral procession, lest rioters try to smash the old Chairman's coffin.\n\nReading a hastily prepared speech, Bunyachenko felt out of his element, standing as he did in front of the sea of blank faces. He had always wondered why the detested Vlasov had lived day after day in hope of redemption. Now the wave of cold contempt threatened to drown KONR's new leader. Russia stood on the brink of unification for the first time in decades.

Well over half of them were wearing the ROA's uniform, the other dead were clearly partisans. The confrontation between the partisans and the local patrol had taken place when a routine inspection of the village led to the discovery of weapons caches, partisans hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe firefight that ensued saw all of the partisans killed, but most of the patrol as well. The dead ROA, which featured kids as young as sixteen, was sorted into one pile, with another, far more uncouth, for the dead partisans, mostly young men and women. Vlasov, who was shocked to hear that there was such a coherent piece of communist resistance so close to the capital, drove out himself to see the aftermath.\n\nAccompanied by two of his bodyguards, he examined the carnage after personally ordering the surviving patrol members to not exact revenge on the surviving villagers. One of the bodyguards, Belochkin, was a personal confidant of the old general. He could tell that for the first time in a long time, Vlasov was filled with emotion - and none of it was good. His mouth formed into a tight-lipped grimace as he walked through the village. An explosion of anger eventually brought the usually laconic general into a yelling fit, shouting at the pile of dead partisans.\n\n"Who are you to think that you could do what you tried to do?" He asked and then paused. Was he waiting for a response? "I have worked years - no, decades - to bring about a Russia free from communism, free from tyranny. And all you people who so stubbornly resist my efforts, indoctrinated by the bastards I beat years ago, you waste the lives of brave, young men who fight my good fight!"\n\nBelochkin was stunned. He looked around, villager and soldier alike froze, observing the marshal's outburst. Glancing towards his fellow bodyguard, he slowly approached Vlasov, who had since fallen silent. Careful not to touch him, Belochkin quietly whispered in his ear.\n\n"Perhaps, my chairman, it is time for us to go. I'm sure you're needed back in Samara."\n\nVlasov weakly agreed; the drive back to the capital was a very quiet one."

The former journalist did not walk into the office so much as he tumbled in, pushed around by the weight of events.\n\n"Zykov. Good to see you." The democratic activist began to speak, only for the chairman to cut him off. "No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress. The officer's committee believes that Oktan is behind everything that's happening right now in the army and the liberated territories. You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces."\n\n"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the officer committee? I should go see them directly"\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. "The officer committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized. I'm in the market for new... associates."\n\nZykov's eyes shone a little brighter. Or had it been just an illusion?

The officers and those judged too radical had been kept on death's row long enough for fellow travellers to the other side to arrive. ROA officers all, corrupt to the bone and kindling for rebellion to a man.\n\nOne of the officers had not travelled far to meet his fate. Hours before recapturing the village, orders had come through for the man's arrest. Citing his insubordination and corruption, the men from Bunyachenko's entourage had relieved the commander of his post and tossed him into a holding cell. None among the soldiers doubted his guilt. The astute few noted the disgraced officer's tie to Oktan's faction. These were bad days for ambitious men within the army of liberation that did not bend the knee to the officer's committee.\n\nSedated by defeat and by an extra set of emergency rations, the villagers crowded mutely around the execution grounds.

"It spreads like a cancer, Arkady..." he said, frustrated with his inability to stop the cretin. "He buys who he buys, and it seems like nowadays everyone has their price." The usually-loquacious Popov seemed dismal, while Antonov, ever the deadpan figure, remained steel-faced. "Well?" asked Bunyachenko.

Together, and under the command of those who had recruited them, he and other volunteers in the militia soon found themselves equipped with surprisingly modern weapons and tasked with holding the city centre against a Vlasovite formation.\n\nMaksim was surprised at how easy it was. The Vlasovites seemed disunited, and he was certain that he had heard shots from their positions, down the street from his own barricade. As the days passed, however, he grew confused. Why wasn't the militia advancing? Why was the commander, the man who had spoken so passionately about revolt and had somehow secured such high-quality weapons, now just sitting in the command post?\n\nHis confusion was only heightened when the commander suddenly ordered them to stockpile their weapons and assemble in formation before himself and his hand-picked officers. And then, as a car drove up and a man emerged, a man Maksim recognized as the local black marketeer and a functionary of the hated General Oktan, it all became, at last and far, far too late, abundantly clear.\n\nA satchel was handed to the commander, the commander gestured to his officers, and the officers raised their weapons. Maksim managed only a half-step before the bullet pierced his skull.

Sobol was a man of the military, ultimately, and his assignment to meet with the American Central Intelligence Agency was because, years ago, he had experience dealing with Soviet intelligence. "An oxymoron, I know", he liked to joke with other ROA members. But there was nothing humorous in the man who sat at a table in the back, poorly illuminated by a combination of candles and old lights. He had a grizzled look about him, a man who clearly hadn't gotten a chance to shave in a few days, some rough scruff growing into a full-fledged beard. As he approached the table, the individual looked up, and slowly rose, shaking Sobol's hand.\n\n"Utkin". He introduced himself in flawless Russian, albeit with the accent of an English speaker. "Parents fled the revolution", he explained further, referencing the Soviets. "Grew up speaking Russian at home, English in school. It's good to meet you, Colonel Maksimov."\n\n'Maksimov?' Thought Sobol. The other man thought he was speaking to Sobol's commanding officer. "Major Sobol, actually. Colonel Maksimov is my superior", the Russian officer responded, taking a seat across from Utkin, trying to ignore the look of disappointed disinterest in the spook's expression. "It's good to finally sit down with you, and discuss our future with America".\n\n"And what future would that be, major?" the agent responded.\n\nThe question took Sobol aback - he had barely been briefed on the meeting, outside of the fact of who he was meeting and what they were discussing. That much became obvious when Sobol stumbled over his words. "Ah, well, recognition. Support-", Sobol responded. As he attempted to go on, he was interrupted by the American.\n\n"Listen. Not that anyone's asking me, but I don't really care about your organization's reputation. I think you're doing God's work. But some of my higher-ups don't feel the same. A lot of the CIA remembers your organization as it was years ago. My being on the ground here doesn't change that. Between you and me?" Utkin leaned in. "You guys have a lot of rebranding to do. Until then, it's going to be very hard for me to convince my handlers of anything."\n\nSobol attempted to protest.\n\n"Isn't it clear that we're not interested in collaboration anymore?

However, Mikhail Oktan was far from the typical statesman. He revelled in the shadows, likening himself to a puppet master at play, jangling around those who he bought or blackmailed as if they were marionettes, setting up corrupt deals and meeting wealthy magnates. In a dingy, run-down bar, where Oktan frequently held court, the type of place where you had to take three alleys from the main street to get there, a special session was taking place.\n\nEver since he had attained his position at the top of the ROA's leadership, Oktan had been frequenting his old contacts less and less, relying on his more trusted and thuggish cronies to tie up loose ends and ensure both compliance and loyalty among those who still had their uses. However, music played loudly, and the raucous nature of his little backalley hideaway betrayed his presence. Sitting at his table that he had specifically made up for himself, seemingly sitting court among the bar patrons, and flanked on all sides by the scariest bodyguards he could buy, Oktan faced a trio of less-than-savoury Russians who lived beyond the Urals. The three men called themselves the Goncharov Brothers, and while none of them were related, each one was nastier than the next. One, a trader from Nizhny Novgorod who dabbled in less savory trades than guns, the second an ashamed "made man" from the thief's territory, and the third a disgraced middling officer from the city of Tyumen accused by Kaganovich's commissars as corrupt. Each one of them had fled from their lives, fleeing stark justice, only to redefine themselves as smugglers who worked for the most powerful, or anyone else who would pay more. The trio had made their first fortune smuggling contraband eastwards, across the Urals. They were still under his employ, but they had been called to talk to the new Grand Marshal, now that he was fully in control of Western Russia. After ensuring that all three of them had some of the nicest vodka in the joint, Oktan opened.\n\n"Gentlemen. I'm sure that all three of you have heard about my promotion."\n\n"But of course, Grand Marshal. A big step up, that's for sure." the man from Tyumen stated.\n\n"Then I won't have to remind you of how important you are to me... now more than ever.

But as the Russian states began to coalesce, its "importance", if it ever had one, was beginning to be forgotten. It had been a key location for an anti-ROA revolt by old-time Pro-Soviet guerrillas, unwilling to accept the primacy of the ROA. As such the village and its inhabitants were treated incredibly harshly when the counterrevolutionary army swept in and slaughtered the partisans that resisted them. The winds of change were clearly afoot, however. An ROA soldier nailed an announcement on the dilapidated bulletin board in the center of the town. As he slunked off, the villagers who had seen him putting up the announcement quickly gathered around the piece of paper, expecting more bad news. They would be surprised - "Martial law to end in one week", the pamphlet claimed. "Village council rule to resume the following". The group was positively shocked as the announcement continued to detail the reach of council rule - which had never been witnessed in Shuvaya - as well as the various responsibilities and powers that were associated with the councils. The pamphlet described council rule as a contract between the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia and each individual village council, where both worked to better themselves and the nation. It was a surprisingly fair deal for the Shuvayan peasants, who had so far been poorly treated by the ROA.\n\nSome of the most skeptical thought that it was a trap - but it became clear that the order was genuine in a week's time when, true to their word, the local ROA garrison withdrew from the town and ended martial law. As the last truck drove down the dirt path back towards civilization, the people of Shuvaya found themselves, temporarily, without government. It was a strange feeling, even for the youngest of villagers. For the first time in a long time, there was peace, they had just been willingly granted autonomy by the soldiers that they once hated. Like a deer in headlights, the people seemed to be stunned. But that very afternoon a group of the most experienced, and, in general, the oldest residents of the village set up a council to prepare themselves for self-government. This council would become one of hundreds, varying in size and importance, to be created by Zykov's relaxation of emergency rule."

It had been doled out to Vadim Kovalevsky so that he and the garrison that was assigned to him could make their way to Yerykly.\n\nKovalevsky, a junior officer of the ROA, was quickly bought by Oktan soon after he received his post, mostly because of Kovalevsky's drinking problem and penchant for violence where needed. He played his role during the tumultuous time between Vlasov's death and Oktan's assumption of power, and because of that, he had been parcelled out a small village and its environs as a reward. Kovalevsky, poorly read and fat off of the luxuries provided by his master, was more than happy, after a few vodkas, of course, to accept the "gift" that Oktan had provided him. The sobering reality of the situation only set in when he was woken up the next morning and told that he was to report to his new fiefdom.\n\nYerykly was a village where the primary export was poverty. The streets were dirt on a good day, mud on most, and the most exciting thing that had happened here since the end of the terror bombings was that one of the cows had given birth to twins. Now, Kovalevsky, who had grown up a refugee from the Germans to the West of Samara, knew desperate times. As he stepped off of his troop truck, he found his welcome completely ignored by most of the village's inhabitants, who continued on with their daily lives. Kovalevsky had a flash, for just a brief moment - the place, somehow, reminded him of home. But as reality sank in, he knew that the relative comfort of Samara was long behind him, and his faint smile turned to grimace.

He had, perhaps most controversially, invited a series of left-leaning politicians as well - those who had definitely been members of the CPSU at one point or another, some of whom even utterly refused to renounce their allegiance to a leftist ideology. The convention - attended by 59 members plus Zykov himself, had been passionately arguing with itself for quite some time. Not just over the nature of the constitution, but the future of Russia as a whole. The only thing that kept the delegates in check were reminders that their participation was contingent on keeping the convention civil, as well as the several armed ROA guards that lined the large conference room.\n\nZykov intermittently participated, but also went about various other duties of state as well, and was thus often absent for a lot of the debates. In his stead, a secretary took what notes he could and sent them off for review by the chairman. Additionally, any changes or proposed clauses to be put in to the constitution were brought to Zykov personally, in front of the convention, where he would give his often-critical opinion on the proposed additions, which tended to be well received by the voting members of the convention - especially considering how many of the delegates were suspiciously oft in agreement with Zykov's "decrees", as some more independent-minded delegates began to seethingly call them.\n\nZykov read over the newest proposed provision for the constitution. Clearly, it had been drafted by the convention's more radical elements - the words that stood out to him were "fully representative democracy". The entire clause called for that and more. Something that Zykov was personally not interested in, but also that even considering implementing something like that would not only alienate the officers of the ROA, but perhaps even induce them to revolt. A dangerous consideration for the chairman who often felt he walked a razor's edge.\n\n"This part here, it's unacceptable to the convention.

He shook hands and saluted all of those who greeted him, and espoused his charismatic, dynamic exterior for the whole convention to see. It almost seemed more a procession than an entrance, but after all, the Grand Marshal did preside over the convention.\n\nAs he took his place at the front of the gathered delegates, he observed those who had earned a place at the convention: from the military wing, his most trusted and skilled generals, those who had earned a place at the Grand Marshal's side. Beside them sat the more junior officers, the ones that he couldn't name, but that he, and his trusted senior comrades, had seen fit to bestow administrative responsibilities to large tracts of land in Western Russia. He may not have known their names, but clearly their hearts were in the right place. Next to them sat the noticeably smaller civilian wing.\n\nThese were the real question marks in Oktan's mind - he had his trusted aides put feelers out in Samara and other large cities under the control of the KONR for any "dynamic individual" who had the money, manpower, and desire to cooperate closely with the Grand Marshal and his plans for the future. These were industrialists, technocrats, disgraced former politicians. Each one of them with an interest and, to Oktan, a payoff.

It was made public that in both federal and provincial courts, that there would be a mixture of civilian and military judges, the latter only making up about a third of the judiciary. The move was controversial, but ultimately in line with the Chairman's vision for a democratic Russia that prioritized the needs of its citizenry. Zykov, still always careful to walk the razor's edge between his vision and the military's reactionism, ensured that those appointed to their respective positions, civilian or military, were in his pocket. That way, at the very least, they could make their case for Zykov and defend his choices to their respective supporters. Of course, the civilian judges and the military judges both had their own agendas - after all, everyone wanted something. But the aim was that, despite their affiliation, they would remain loyal to the Chairman.\n\n"Welcome to your new office, judge". Anatoly Ignatov's brother said, emphasizing his new title as the pair of them entered into the large room. A comfortable area, the office would be the headquarters for Ignatov's new job - that of judge. He had been handpicked by the ROA following the chairman's insistence on forming a coherent and comprehensive judiciary. Despite the fact that he was a civilian, he met with Zykov's deputies, who, apparently, were enamored with the now-judge's ideas of justice and sensibility. Of course, the position wasn't without responsibilities, nor was Ignatov's conscience clean; the former community leader did have to make some deals with the deputies to ensure that he got the position. This of course, included an unspoken provision that he was to be loyal to the chairman, and by extension, the entire committee. But this was a small price to pay for the position that he now found himself in. As he explored the room, his brother, in awe at the place, asked him a question. "So where will you start?

The years of idleness in and around Samara have seen a large amount of Imperial and Soviet laws grafted to the civil and criminal code wherever the ROA's officer judged it fit.\n\nChairman Bunyachenko's advisors have trimmed this ball of legal precedents down to coherent and useful civil and military codes. These will be enacted by a new system of tribunals staffed with former ROA soldiers. The supreme court of the republic itself will be stacked with men loyal to the chairman.

Meetings about funding, meetings about peasant unrest, meetings about what uniforms he could and couldn't wear in public. After he had finished his lunch, he had dismissed all of his meetings for the rest of the day - except one, his aide reminded him. He couldn't possibly postpone the meeting of prominent military and civilian officials to finalize the judiciary system in the Provisional Commissariat. Especially, as the aide had pointed out, that the officers who he was meeting with, he had sent them out to their fiefs but had so soon recalled them.\n\nReluctantly, and with a belly fuller than he could remember, he sat down with the eight individuals, five military and three civilian, to hash out and complete the judicial code for the Russia that he envisioned. Despite his lethargic outlook, he soon took to the task with his normal charisma, cracking jokes and living up to his image as the most sociable head of state west of the Urals.\n\n"So, let's get down to business, shall we?" He asked those gathered, laziness rapidly dissipating in favour of excitement. The Grand Marshal laid out a number of documents, which were passed around the group. "As you can see, we're looking at a dual military-civilian system. The military governor of a province appoints a political chief, which deals with any civilian case in the district, but can be appealed or vetoed by the military governor. Cases won't be able to be taken federally, the military governor is the highest say." Oktan shifted in his chair, looking more towards the officers. "Military disputes will be handled federally. A group of officers will serve in positions as judges and will be handpicked by me. A judge can be removed if the majority of the judges vote them off, or if I want them off. I'd pick a successor. These disputes and proceedings would be similar to military tribunals, complete with your pick of various legal provisions."

Make it it's own district, there's no way we can predict what'll happen there."\n\nToday, Zykov's vision of a unicameral system of parliament to represent "all the peoples of Russia'' began its first step towards realization. Zykov announced the formation of a parliament following general elections during a grand ceremony in Samara, where apparently, "all free Russians'' would be able to vote. The reaction to this announcement was mixed among the people of Russia.\n\nIn places like Samara, which had known ROA rule for so long, it was a welcome relief to military rule, and Yedinstvo, the political party representing the ROA, candidates were projected to win in landslides. In other places, the news of elections were more tentative.\n\nThe gentry of Syktyvkar, those who survived its conquest, were cynical and suspicious of the elections, and immediately pointed out the great degree of gerrymandering that had gone on in certain areas. This gerrymandering, likely, they claimed, all but ensured the victory of the Yedinstvo in various areas to make sure that its interests were represented in the government. But Zykov's official representatives denied this claim vehemently.\n\nIn the north, where the Soviet remnants once reigned supreme, feelings were ambivalent. For the ideological hardliners, those who fled with the front, rigorous campaigning for candidates as left as was allowed occurred, but many others, natives, cared little.

Their counter proposal of a legislature appointed by the officer's committee brought the convention to a stand still for some time until chairman Bunyachenko brought along a new proposal of a bicameral legislature. An elected lower chamber would keep accountable an appointed upper house.\n\nCynics could accuse this scheme of favoring the Chairman's own interests in the long run. The democratic lower house's extremely limited power would impose few restrictions on the actions of the senate. A realist, however, would see how astute the Chairman's compromise solution was in threading the needle between various interest groups.\n\nIn return for Bunyachenko's partial support for their proposal, the officer's committee agreed to let him appoint many of the initial senators for five year terms. The list of candidates being brought forward by the Chairman's faction is expected to contain loyalists to the president, technocrats and industrialists willing to enact the president's rumored radical reforms.

Mikhail Oktan, once he had secured his position at the head of the Committee, took over the office and had it transformed into his own personal throne room. Entering from the front, a long red carpet led from the oaken double doors to the large, ancient desk that the Grand Marshal sat at. Portraits of great Russians, including Oktan himself, adorned the walls, but there was a conspicuous lack of Vlasov's presence. Throughout most of the day, Oktan and his closest confidants caroused themselves and those that they met with to the point that the Grand Marshal could barely remember everything that he had done and all who he had met with.\n\n"Clearly our dear, departed leader was doing this all wrong!" Okan exclaimed to uproarious laughter, exactly when Grigory Lagunov stepped into the room. The officer was a newcomer to the ROA's senior ranks, and was considered a bit of a teetotaler. His uniform was always immaculate and he never slouched, nor did he ever drink or smoke.\n\n"You wanted to see me, Grand Marshal?"\n\nOktan made a welcoming gesture, practically begging the man to join them. "Yes, yes! Come in, please! I wanted to see you, Colonel Lagunov," Oktan's face dropped his smile, and he turned deadpan. "About something very, very serious." Oktan and his company watched as the color drained from the colonel's face.\n\nThey gave it a few seconds, allowing the officer, who surely thought that he was about to be shot, to advance towards them before they burst out into laughter. "Look at your face!" the Grand Marshal cackled. "No, no, nothing like that..." He said, calming himself down after a fit of laughter. "The Committee would like you to... well, grant you the governorship of the province of Nizhny Novgorod!"\n\nLagunov, clearly not having recovered from the fright, wasn't quite sure what to say. "A... a governorship?" He repeated. Oktan rolled his eyes.\n\n"Come now, don't be so suspicious. Is this because of the joke? I'm sorry. Yes, we want you to govern the region. You'll be subject to the federal government, of course, which means that you'll owe taxes, as well as conscription and equipment levies. But you can make your own laws, within reason of course, so long as they only apply within the borders of the area that you control! How's that sound?"\n\nThe colonel was taken aback. He had been smart enough to keep his head down during Oktan's accession, but he had never expected this. "I... well, I must accept."

Any injuries are to be reported directly to me before the wounded individual is taken to the aid station. For those of you who do not know, you are being paid $1.00 above the minimum wage. Are there any questions?"\n\nThe Perm Armaments Factory no.32 opened today, as one of many government-controlled enterprises that did the same under Zykov's dual public-private sector industrial policy. This factory, like its sister facilities all across the territory of the Provisional Commissariat, would be working day-in and day-out to produce weapons and ammunition for the ever-hungry ROA. Owned and operated by the government, these arms factories, once seen as a dreadful deal by a number of local residents, had become beacons of job stability and good pay as a result of government investment into making working conditions and wages livable, at the very least. Zykov had worked for a long time to ensure a good, stable industrial base for the ROA back when it was scratching out a meager existence around Samara, and later once he was the guiding hand behind Vlasov's policies. Now that he was at the helm of the Provisional Commissariat, a coherent, effective, and most importantly, fair, industrial policy had been put in place by Zykov and his administration.\n\nThe military industry would be almost entirely state-controlled: The line between the military-industrial sector and the ROA itself seemed to be distinct, if blurry at times. This way the state could guide the necessities of military production while also ensuring that the needs of the soldiers are met. The civilian sector, however, was almost immediately privatised. The government sold off a number of factories that had been seized during the ROA's conquest of Western Russia, and those they couldn't sell, they simply handed out to conglomerates and corporations. Working conditions were exponentially better than they had been a mere few years ago, and while a civilian factory job was far from perfect, it was, at least, stable."

The new Chairman, however, silenced the feverish complaints that such a project could not be realized. Had the Japanese not carved an empire of steel in Manchuria where once only dusty steppe could be found? Had not the damn Bukharinists developed the central Siberian heavy industry in such a time span?\n\nCombining a modern central financial system and interlocking shareholders, a select set of industrial concerns would be expanded horizontally and vertically into economical juggernauts dubbed kombinats. The presence of allies of the government in key financial institutions would be used to feed loyal businesses, and prevent hostile takeovers by national or international rivals. In preparation for liberation of the rest of Russia, military supplying contracts would provide initial fuel for the rise of these kombinats.\n\nBunyachenko's speech concluded, the chairman stood and answered questions.

The pair, alongside the rest of their squad, had finally been taken off of frontline action in a standard troop rotation, and Volkov found himself oddly empty. To his surprise, he had enjoyed his time on the frontlines, even during the bloody unification wars against the Tsarists, communists, and others. He had felt a pride in his chest, as if he was doing something good for the first time in his life, and that he was working towards something greater than himself. But rearguard duty was sort of boring to the young corporal. As he pulled off his new boots, he noted how much comfier they were than the ones he had been issued when he first joined up. Storing his assault rifle, he recalled the days when he had been given: a German-made Kar98k, the bolt of which seemed to jam after every other shot. Now what he - and his entire squad, for that matter - were issued could seemingly be dragged through the mud and still work. The changes were incredibly apparent for the young man, who had witnessed vast change in his relatively short tenure. As he sat back down on his bunk, Pavlovsky, across from him, was reading. With change in his mind, he asked the grizzled veteran, "Say, Pavlovsky, what do you think of everything that's changed?"\n\nA small grin crept over Pavlovsky's face as he turned his head to face Volkov and closed his book. "I think that the changes are pretty crazy. If you told me, three year ago, that I'd be sitting here with a belly full of food, clothes that haven't been worn by three other people before me, and a gun that works, I'd have told you that you're crazy". The man was notoriously laconic, but Volkov always pressed him for more. "Have you ever seen anything like this before? I mean... When the army was forced to fight with the Germans".\n\nSilence, before Pavlovsky's response came. "Oh, God, I can't remember, it seems". He ran a hand through his silver scruff. "I can barely even remember the equipment they gave us. The missions we were given. Complete suicide, they were. You'd be lucky to get their assault rifle, the StG. Usually you'd have old rifles, the ones that... I guess their own soldiers couldn't use?" There was a pause, the old soldier sighing. "There are so few of us left from then.

This informal network, known as the "Shepchushchaya Galereya", or whispering gallery, had become the paramount organization for intelligence gathering and dissention prevention. Zykov knew that it was indispensable, and the sheer size of both the Galereya's agents and the territory they now had to cover essentially warranted by necessity its reformation into an official, government-sanctioned agency: The Ministry of Truth. From the lowliest soldier to some of the highest ranking officials in Zykov's realm, suddenly, as informants, they found themselves under the scrutiny of a new set of handlers, professionally and deftly collecting information and dispensing rewards as needed.\n\nCorporal Gennady Bogomolov sat in a barren office, nervously smoking. The young soldier, having willingly joined the ROA not too long ago, had already begun a seemingly-meteoric rise through the ranks due to his loyalty and leadership qualities.

Bogomolov watched Viktorov, the officer's back to him, as he searched his records for two specific names. It was clear Viktorov was no soldier - longer hair, a scruffy beard, and, while hardly noticeable to the untrained eye, a small pot belly that betrayed the luxury that he had known. However, the bureaucrat-turned-agent's reputation for making Zykov's problems go away had preceded him. There were even rumors flying around the NCOs that if Viktorov arrived at your barracks, it was because he was planning to clean house. But Viktorov had been with Bogomolov's garrison for over a week and no arrests nor executions had come.\n\n"You did the right thing, coming to me about this", Viktorov said, still leaning over his files, before eventually picking a pair of them up and sliding them across the table. "It's these two you were speaking of, correct?" Personnel files on two separate soldiers who had been on the pay of Oktan were shown to Bogomolov.\n\nThe corporal took a long drag from his cigarette. "Yes, these two. What'll happen to them?" Viktorov smiled an empty smile.\n\n"That's for me to worry about. You're dismissed.

His family had lived in a relatively large town, and as it was taken by the ROA, it seemed that their rule would be more of the same. Martial law, restrictions on gatherings and what people could do. But as their victory became more assured, it seemed as if their grip on the town slipped. It was a deceptive slipping, of course - as peace returned to Western Russia, Zykov's armed forces helped transition their new state from military to civilian rule .

 SAM.77.desc:0 "A great hush had fallen upon Western Russia following the reforms that Chairman Zykov had undertaken. This hush was not one of anticipation, nor one of death, but instead, for the first time in a long time, one of peace. This peace, however, was not one of a willing populace. The reality of the situation was that, even if the chairman ruled with a velvet glove, he had seized Russia through the use of an iron fist - a massive one: The ROA. Resistance to his rule was dealt with calmly if possible, but if Zykov's words couldn't pacify his enemies, well, the guns of his loyalists could. Despite the sweeping political and economic reforms that had been instituted, and despite the fact that military rule - martial law - had been lifted from almost all places within the control of the Provisional Commissariat, the streets in the towns and the cities were usually empty and solemn, save for the occasional person hurrying to work, or a patrol of ROA soldiers. In truth, the Russia that Zykov had begun to shape was one of relative freedom - elections, a liberalized economy, apart from the arms manufacturing sector, and a relatively fair judiciary. The reality of his vision paired with the legacy of the forces that he has to work with means that at least for now, the long shadow cast by the armed forces across Western Russia is here to stay.\n\nBut even then, all of that considered, Russia under the Provisional Commissariat is significantly better than it was during the terror bombings and the interlude before its unification. There was peace, and there was bread. There were jobs, and there were measures against bandits. While the peace was secured through arms, and those arms were very present in seemingly all throughout the commissariat, peace reigns. For now. These thoughts, always on the mind of the enigmatic chairman, swirled throughout his brain, causing him to wonder what the next step was - stability now, but for what, if there Russia remained disunited?"

In the distance, vast industrial complexes taken from the dying WRRF were being set back up by private interests.\n\nFor now, the poor men and women in question huddled in refugee camps.

Their car stopped at an intersection where a smartly dressed soldier verified the vehicle's papers, his modern assault rifle slung on his shoulder. At a nearby corner, the analyst could see a tram letting go of its cargo of clerks and professionals. West Russia's burgeoning commercial empires were nourished by a steady stream of mandarins.

There was the old Third Republic with its President and its Prime Minister, one being the head of state and the other who wrangled the government. Of all these choices, none expected Zykov to take the one he did. Zykov walked the balance between ideal and practicality as he balanced the military's tendency towards reaction with the dream of a government by the people, for the people. And in that walk, Zykov chose to take what was good from what the Committee knew of other nations and blend it all together. Russia would have a head of state, who was commander in chief. A symbol, a leader for the military, a theoretical power with a grand potential never to be tapped. Yet there would be the actual governance of the state, the executive to be run by the elected government and which would, eventually, have the faith and loyalty of the army.\n\nIn time things would stabilize, but until then there would be a compromise.

A smile and a few jokes about food and waistlines drew smiles, and Oktan shuffled papers about until he got the one he wanted.

Strikes had slowed the project down by a month or so, but strike-breakers paid with government bills had shown the rabble that the new provisional government would not tolerate such communist nonsense anymore.\n\nHe read through the document, finally signing his name on the final page to acknowledge that he had received it. He tapped his pen against his teeth in contemplation, the little silver end clacking against the white of his mouth. Economics, science, and state had begun to slowly twist and curl together ever since the appointment of Leonid Samutin to the position of economic minister in Zykov's cabinet. It was a far cry from the handful of factories and home mills that had sustained Samara before unifying Western Siberia, an economic miracle unrivaled in the post-Soviet world.\n\nLeonid smiled to himself.

Subsequently, they have announced the immediate cessation of any and all relations, interactions, or contact of any kind between themselves and the Reich to anyone who will listen.\n\nThe ROA, formerly under the leadership of Andrey Vlasov, proved itself valuable both during Operation Barbarossa and in the West Russian War, and contact between the Reich and cliques within their military-led government have proven beneficial in the years since. Clearly, however, the internal political balance has shifted, towards a faction unfriendly to our interests and non-receptive to our support.\n\nThe announcement, both in general and in terms of response, has been given a low priority by both the Foreign Ministry and the OKW. The situation in Russia remains mostly unclear, with the nominal political consolidation of various territories, including those of the ROA, significantly undermined by administrative overextension, insurgent efforts by escaped loyalists of defeated regimes, and other internal tensions.\n\nMilitarily, they are expected to pose no threat to Wehrmacht forces should a limited or escalated conflict begin.

This center-left organization, having managed to squirm its way out from under Zykov's suppression of the Left, has laid itself plainly into the public eye. Rumyantsev has presented a platform that has proven appealing to the people of the republic, promising to work to ban voter suppression and extend the vote to émigrés.

 SAM.96.desc:0 "FIELD MARSHAL'S EYES ONLY\n\nTo Field Marshal Bunyachenko,\n\nABSTRACT: The Committee for the revitalization of controlled territories has found that while economically it can be of much use, the destruction and lack of economic planning has made the use of such resources unavailable to our use. Thus some elements of economic planning are proposed to 'jump start' the economy for the purposes of beginning the long awaited reunification of Russia.\n\nREPORT SUMMARY: It has been found that a significant amount of factories have been destroyed from either raids from opposing warlords, or due to German terror bombings. What few remain suffer from a lack of manpower. Similar outcomes occur in construction and extraction industries. In spite of this, the unemployment rate is high, especially in urban areas. This has caused suffering among families, who rely on charity to get by. For full analysis, see pages 20 through 54 of this report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: To use government powers to enforce an end to unemployment, through a combination of government assistance, relocation of the unemployed towards areas and industries where needed most, and, when no other option is available, conscription into the armed forces. While this would expand government powers into the economy thus unseen, it would make it (a) more viable and attractive to do business and (b) increase productivity of the average citizen through additional wages.

Poverty has decreased, unemployment is nearly non-existent, and for the first time in years new factories are being created throughout the country. The unemployment program has even been so successful that juveniles (13-17 being the majority) makeup a significant portion of the workforce, although by no means a majority. While far from done, the program has made much progress in revitalizing the economy, which has benefited military production in domestic firearms, making unification a more likely outcome. See pages 18 through 30 for full report.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: Aside from continuing the program, it is recommended that additional resources be made available to increase business opportunity.

Even the presence of trusted men such as the village's priest did not inspire much confidence.\n\nEventually a first test of the new legal structure presented itself. A young man had allegedly been found rummaging through a neighbor's pantry, and had taken a bullet in the back for his trouble. The youth had survived, and his family were now accusing their neighbors of attempted murder. The accused had asked the tribunal's help, as few believed his side of the story. Better risk the military's justice than wait out a lynching.\n\nThe military officer acting as judge did a commendable job of patiently taking on both sides of the story. The jury of four soldiers and five civilians then adjusted for deliberations. A non-guilty verdict for the accused was reached. The judge then imposed on the man a few weeks of community service, as well as a fine meant to pay for the care of the injured youth.\n\nAll across Samara, a range of issues began having their day in court. From criminal cases to perfectly mundane administrative topics, agreements and rulings were handed out. Grudgingly, the civilians came to trust the military's willingness to collaborate with them for the sake of law and order."

 SAM.301.t:0 "The Democratic Successor"
 SAM.301.desc:0 "Miletiy Alexandrovich Zykov. The name bounced around the aide's head. Vlasov had been long silent about a potential political successor for him in the case of his death or incapacitation. However, it was obvious to everyone who was anyone in the ROA that the chairman wasn't getting any younger. But Zykov? Certainly an unorthodox choice. Vlasov had convened an emergency meeting of all of his aides nearly half an hour ago to make a preliminary announcement to them. But the announcement had turned into a discussion - the move was shocking to a number of the more conservative aides, who thought that the transition to Zykov would be a disaster. Truthfully, Vlasov was an alright boss. An aide never had to fear reprisals for small mistakes, like they did under many other senior officers. All were free to express their opinions there, so long as they were respectful. Luchenko, one of the aide's peers, voiced his. "Zykov's gone as far as proposing the reinstitution of democracy, but the people know nothing of democracy. Most don't care. Will they even understand what that would mean? I worry that all we have worked to build will devolve into the chaos that we've heard is going on in Syktyvkar". The field marshal retorted in a tired but firm tone. "Zykov may want democracy, Luchenko, but have we not been working towards a free Russia? What Russia is free but does not allow the people freedom?" There was silence for a bit. Another aide, one of Luchenko's good friends, finally spoke up. "But, and if I may, there are some doubts that some of the staff have about Zykov's true intentions. Even if he were to... assume power... after you..." The aide seemed to stumble. "Some worry that he doesn't even believe in democracy, and will attempt to use it as a personal power tool." Vlasov grimaced briefly. It was clear that it had been a thought that had crossed his mind. "His true intentions may be ambiguous. That may be true, but it never leaves this room. Even if he was not to restore democracy, I believe in his ability to restore hope. And right now? That's what we need most. We need to give the Russian people hope." There was a pause. Vlasov was far from a talented orator, but all were aware of the poor opinion of their organization with most of the subjects they ruled - Zykov had always been a propagandist. "Dismissed." Vlasov barked."

 SAM.302.desc:0 "Andrey Sidorov, long-time aide to the long-suffering Vlasov, was called into his office alongside approximately a dozen other of his peers, from aides to administrative assistants, all of those who were relevant to Vlasov's immediate life. A few chairs had been scattered around, but most had to stand. Vlasov himself was behind his oaken desk, the entire barren room brightly framed by the large window immediately behind him. The old chairman took a cursory glance outside before turning towards Sidorov and the rest of the crowd. "It's no secret that there's been some consternation about the matter of our movement's leadership after I am gone." It was a plain statement, and one that was definitely true. Aides like Sidorov would spend whole meals discussing the matter as if they were adolescents discussing romantic interests. "I have taken a significant amount of time to think about the matter, and I have decided that I will be nominating Sergey Bunyachenko as the next in line for Chairman of our committee." Most of the aides nodded. After all, Bunyachenko was a sensible choice. He was popular with most of the officers and generally avoided shady dealings that some of his peers gleefully engaged in. One of the aides, however, a "friend" of Mikhail Oktan's, piped up. "But why Bunyachenko? I don't get it". A pensive look flashed over Vlasov's face for a minute, before he responded. "Good question", he started, looking directly into the aide's eyes, knowingly. "The ROA is filled with rot - corruption, bribery, nepotism, anything that you can name. I'm no fool, I know it exists. Bunyachenko is a strong, honest man and an honorable general. I know that he will be both a good compromise candidate between our ideologically passionate peers and those who are less so. And I also know that he will work to expose and purge the rot from our organization, forcefully if need be. For if we are to rule all Russia, we need a man and an organization that is free from corruption and interested enough in crushing our enemies to not put his own interests above our ultimate goals. And ultimately..." Vlasov's voice broke before he continued. "I believe he is the only person who can succeed where I have been unable to." The question was not followed up with another - Vlasov solemnly dismissed the aides and instructed them to inform those necessary."

Whatever the meeting was about, thought Andrey Sidorov, one of his key aides, it was serious. Sidorov had been with Vlasov for half a decade, and had witnessed the slide of the once-proud general into what Sidorov believed to be depression, but even he was not prepared for the announcement that Vlasov was prepared to make. After the dozen or so KONR and ROA officers and various aides had taken their seats in chairs that had been hastily brought in by those not privy to the meeting, Vlasov had stood up, and addressed his "crowd". "We are all aware," he began, "that there is the matter of succession within our movement. It has been a matter of contention for some time that when it is time for me to hand off the torch, who would be the one to receive it." There was a pause - a reluctant, grimacing pause, before he continued. "And as such, I have decided that General Mikhail Oktan will be the one to bear the burden of succession". Almost immediately after the name was mentioned, the room began to erupt into discord. Sidorov himself was baffled; Oktan? Even among his allies, Oktan had a reputation for corruption and administrative negligence. He was a decent officer, a sight better than the "cadets" who "volunteered", but nothing special, and he was no friend of Vlasov. Vlasov's voice suddenly boomed throughout the room, a single command - "Silence!" It was obeyed. "Oktan already owns half of the Russian Liberation Army. He attracts those damned opportunists and lackeys, bribing those who can be bought and sidelining those who can't." Vlasov continued to calmly explain his decision. "But if it is anyone but Oktan succeeds me, I worry for the continued existence of our movement. Even if I were to choose someone else, we cannot afford a civil war, and surely Oktan would act against anyone who seeks to exert more control over him than I currently have. This is for the best of the Committee, and the best for the Russian Liberation Army. My decision is final. Prepare to relay it to those who need to know. Dismissed!"\n\nThere is a long, dark night falling upon Russia, and neither the brightest of moons nor stars will be able to penetrate the blackness projected by the Chairman's last decision."

It did not matter to Semyon, so long as they didn't try anything funny.\n\n"Hey! Semyon! Semyon, over here!" Semyon turned to face the source of the voice, and an eyebrow rose in annoyed surprise at the familiar face running towards him. "Ah, General Bunyachenko ordered that no soldier patrol alone for the time being. One of our own got badly beaten by dissidents. I volunteered to join you, seeing as we're old friends." Fyodor explained, having no way of knowing their friendship was not mutual. As they began to walk together despite Semyon's reluctance, Fyodor's latest topic of conversation caught Semyon's interest for once. "...By the way, Semyon, I've been thinking about this for a while, but don't you think it's weird? Bunyachenko's a Ukrainian, yet he's prominent over here instead."\n\nFrowning, Semyon scratched his chin in confusion. "What's so odd about a Ukrainian in Russia?"\n\n"It's not just him." Fyodor quickly assured him. "Old man Kromiadi's a Greek, from down in the Caucasus, and Bayerski is a genuine Pole." Fyodor's voice began to grow hushed. "Nobody really knows anything about Oktan, either, and there are all kinds of rumors swirling about. The most common seem to be that he's a Croat, or a Serb, something like that, and the son of a Balkan baron. And then there's Zykov, who admits he's a Ukranian, and nothing else. I've heard a few rumors that he's a Jew, but-" before he could get anything else out, Fyodor found his mouth covered by Semyon's hand. It'd be a lie to say that he liked the annoying gossip at all, but just hearing something like that could place people in danger.\n\n"Fyodor, perhaps it'd be wisest if we moved on to another topic of conversation." With a withering glare from Semyon, the rest of the patrol was conducted in silence."

 # the monthly shipment
 SAM.305.t:0 "The Monthly Shipment"
 SAM.305.desc:0 "One of the oddest phenomena in the territory controlled by the ROA was a small train station about an hour's march from the city of Samara. Previously a small stop from West Russia to the city, the station's real name had long been replaced by another. The Contraband Station, as it was now known, was one of the last stops for German smugglers - RK Moskowien garrison members who were paid too little to justify the risks they took. These smugglers, who brought with them just about anything a Russian soldier could dream of, made lucrative deals with the local garrisons to sell them things from tobacco and tea to chocolate and small mementos. Any luxury products that managed to trickle their way down into German-occupied Russia were made available to the ROA soldiers. It was one of the largest benefits to signing on with the ROA - simply put. Their old 'contacts' with the Germans had allowed them to afford a few more luxuries than their ideological rivals.\n\nAs both German and Russian worked to offload the goods from the train, they chatted with one another in broken fragments of their respective tongues, each side having made clear efforts to learn the other's language. One of the Russians asked a German about his family;\n\n"I don't know, honestly", he responded. "They're back in Prussia. I've heard that there's not much in the way of work, but other than that, there's been no word". The German, wanting to be courteous, responded in kind. "What about here? What's life like in Samara?" The Russian chuckled a little bit.\n\n"I wouldn't know. I haven't seen the city in weeks, this is my first time being remotely close to it. Border patrols, skirmishes with bandits. I'm sure you're familiar."\n\nContraband Station was an incredibly strange site for cultural intermingling. The Russian soldiers didn't like their German counterparts who supplied the contraband, and they were confident that the Germans felt the same about them. And yet, the Russians attempted to learn German, and the Germans tried their hand at Russian. Everyone knew each other's names, food was shared, and jokes were made even if the language barrier impeded communication at times. Ultimately, both sides were a part of each other's lives, and both accepted that fact, even if they didn't like those that the fact was made up of."

 SAM.306.t:0 "The Iron Harvest"
 SAM.306.desc:0 ""Harvest Days" was what they were called around these parts. ROA soldiers would descend upon the town in their full battle dress, and proceed to help the local farmers with their harvest, providing the valuable manpower that their fields needed especially since so many of their sons had been conscripted or killed. When the harvest days had first been put in place, there was little trust or goodwill between the soldiers and the villagers, especially considering one of the reasons the soldiers helped out with the harvests was to take some of the food back with them. But as the harvest days became more regular, and the village became more acclimatized to the presence of the ROA they began to see them not as German collaborators, but as protectors. The atmosphere changed, trust was built between civilian and soldier. Eventually, some members of the ROA even began volunteering for the harvest days - usually conscripts who had a background in agriculture - hoping to be assigned to one. With some of the friendliest villages even offering to feed the soldiers during the day, it was a relatively comfortable assignment compared to border patrols or anti-bandit operations.\n\nWhile the Committee for the Liberation of the Russian People was far from popular, they had been working hard to secure their regime, distance themselves from the Germans, and even improve their relations with those that they ruled over. These harvests were a key part of that, and contributed to the image that the ROA was there to help, not hurt; to a large extent, it seemed that it was working. No one liked taxes, especially when they were being extracted in the form of food, and oftentimes after the harvests many of the farmers would stare jealously at the ROA's trucks as they pulled away from their village, wishing they had been able to keep more of the food they had grown. However, on the whole, it was a positive experience. The soldiers had even been effective in getting a few of the local boys and restless farmhands to sign up with the ROA, which further helped dissipate tensions with the locals. Most of the core of the ROA had no local ties to the area around Samara, and having patrols protect those that they knew was a huge boon for the KONR's propaganda machine."

When men of the Imperial Army entered, there was a momentary tension. That too died down as the Vlasovites offered a round of drinks to the Imperials.\n\nTalks ebbed and flowed on a range of topic. A particularly violent group of bandits that both groups of soldiers had fought with (the bastards). The recent weather (mostly bad). The news from beyond the Urals (very confused). Eventually the topic moved to the WRRF. A few of the veterans of both groups had fought in the fifties. After comisserating on the shame of fighting fellow Russians to defeat the reds, the soldiers shared war stories back and forth. A few more rounds were shared. This casual conversation marked the high point of the evening's mood. Eventually a bitter dispute erupted as to the legitimacy of the ROA. Had it not begun as a German militia, dogs for the invaders? The ROA veteran snapped back that the tsar had been invited by the Germans, and that the white soldiers should not talk about serving tyrants, foreign or domestic.\n\nThe barman did not speak.

The commander of the local garrison, Major Popov, noted that the time was 12:32, well past the time that the strike should have dispersed. He radioed his troops who were observing the situation over at the factories - ROA troops frequently mediated between employers and employees, especially during tense situations like this one. He asked a simple question - "Have they dispersed?" The answer Popov got was not the one that he was hoping for. "The strikers won't give up", the voice on the other end of the radio responded. "Worse still, there's some rumors among the workers still here and their managers that the strike was actually orchestrated by communist agents, 'plants', as they call them. Things are getting pretty tense, people are throwing things". What came after that was what really worried Major Popov. "Some of the greener troops... I think they're unnerved. If things go south, they might start shooting."\n\nPopov cursed to himself. The damned strikers. It was the third time in three months that this had happened, and each time, it was up to the ROA to sort things out. How many times would he have to deal with this before he made his superiors understand that he, and those he commanded, were soldiers, not policemen? Regardless, Popov had to make a choice - he could send in his troops to disperse the strikers, and potentially kill or weed out the apparent communist plants. Surely, this would calm things down and set a precedent to the ungrateful strikers that their insubordination would not be tolerated. It might make us unpopular in the short run but it would also ensure the stability in our streets, for workers will surely be reluctant to complain if it meant being on the wrong end of the barrel of a gun. However, Popov would have the lives of those workers on his hands. Similarly, if he refused to send in the army, the workers would be happy, and alive of course, but business interests would feel betrayed. It wasn't an easy call by any means, but Popov knew that he would have to make it - it would be a PR disaster if his recruits lost their cool and fired into the crowds."

As a result, it didn't take long for news of an envoy from the east to arrive at a local garrison station. The ROA was consistently weary about outsiders and strangers, to the point where a diplomat from beyond the Urals instantly kicked up suspicion. Maksim Oliynyk, the offer in charge of the garrison station that the envoy had been escorted to, didn't particularly want to meet the man - in fact, he was suspicious that the man was who he claimed he was.\n\nSitting down with the envoy, it was clear that he was frustrated. Protesting his being whisked away to the garrison, rather than Samara itself. Oliynyk sat down with the man, looking at him up and down. "Who are you?" he asked, "and why have my caravan and I been stolen away here? I am bound for Samara."\n\nThe commander took a pause before he responded. "For all that matters to you, I am Samara. Now, tell me, who are you?"\n\nSome further protests were given, but the envoy soon realized that he wasn't getting anywhere. He relinquished, and eventually introduced himself as a diplomat hailing from Novosibirsk, beyond the Urals. The meeting became closer to an interrogation, with Oliynyk learning about the events that were going on in the east. The envoy, after the questioning was over, attempted to offer to trade with the ROA. Oliynyk's polite, but cold "no, thank you" dissuaded him, and he left back to Novosibirsk soon after."

 SAM.310.desc:0 "Armaments Factory no.14 was a small complex near the Samara railyards. "Repurposed" by the ROA itself during the darkest days of the terror bombing, the small shack was soon built up. The "factory" - in reality little more than a large building with a few long, wooden tables and a number of machine tools - was dedicated to taking apart German small arms and reverse engineering them for our own purposes. Vlasov and most of those under him knew well that their German support would eventually run out, and they had long made provisions to ensure that their myriad of German equipment, from Kar98Ks to StG-44s would remain operable even once it was no longer possible to receive their parts from their former benefactors neither officially nor through smugglers. The factory rarely worked during the day - the bombings made it hard to - but workers toiled all night, with small headlamps and minimal light, disassembling old or well-worn rifles and their respective ammunitions. These workers, despite their rugged condition, were not civilians. Not officially, at least. They were engineers, not just employees of the ROA, but members of it and experienced in handling German weapons for many years. Until recently, the factory had been minimally staffed. However, with the increasing amount of bloody victories won by the ROA, the soldiers at the frontline needed more and more weapons, and the number of those that we can get from German smugglers is becoming miniscule compared to our needs. As such, Armaments Factory no.14 has, as of recently, expanded not only in terms of manpower, but location as well. A number of shoddily-constructed buildings have been added to the original to form a sort of complex, where dedicated stations and senior engineers act as efficiency-generating machines. As of late the factory was no longer just reverse-engineering weapons, but producing their own versions of them. Certainly not with the workmanship of the originals, they were cheap and easy to produce, and that's what the high command wanted."

He had intentionally ordered the removal of most luxuries from his office and his living quarters two years prior, in a vain attempt to stave off his ever-present guilt. The old marshal stood, looking out the window, a drink in hand. He couldn't remember the time, all he knew was that it was dark out. Midnight, maybe? 1? 2? Who cared. The night was the only time that Vlasov could be alone. Every waking hour of the day he had aides, officers, and administrators asking him the most mundane of questions, but lately he had become disinterested in answering them, instead preoccupying himself with a reflection on his life's work. What was it, if not the Committee? And what had they accomplished? At what cost? These were the questions that resounded in Vlasov's head day and night. "And for the life of me, I can't figure out the answers." he mumbled to himself. He couldn't even remember if his alliance with the Nazis was one of pragmatic survival or the desire to see a Russia forged in his image. He barely had an image anymore. He continued to pace around his room, occasionally glancing up to the stoic portrait of himself that his aides insisted he keep in his office. A single word came to his mind: legacy. What was to be his legacy? Vlasov had always thought about writing a book. After all, who else would tell his story the way that it should be told? "The Germans remember me as a traitor, the Russians remember me as worse. Those in the West barely even know who I am." He stated to no one in particular. Realistically, no book would be coming. Vlasov knew he couldn't. After pacing some more, he sat, slumped in his desk chair, looking at his drink. It had become harder to resist the urges to refill the glass over and over with the premium vodka he had "liberated" for himself. He looked to his glass - it was now empty. When did he drink it? He couldn't remember. Glancing towards his desk, there were two items that came to his attention - the bottle and his service pistol.

Years of promotion, attrition and desertion have unbalanced our officer pool, especially at the junior level. Our army is now dangerously top heavy, and needs new blood to fill out its command structure.\n\nFortunately, local recruits form a satisfactory pool of potential officers. The only issue is that the years of sitting around have begun polarizing the soldiers into three different groups. Some of the more idealistic recruits follow Zykov's faction, and argue that the ROA should live up to its promises of liberation and democracy. In contrast, a group of black market smugglers and hardline fascists have coalesced around general Oktan's promises of a strong Russia where the soldiers are fully respected. In between these two hands, the officer committee tries to maintain the status quo by recruiting dutiful and apolitical men who share General Bunyachenko's apathy and desire to see the junta's structure endure until the situation has changed.\n\nThe composition of officers we choose will help determine the direction the ROA takes.

"It spreads like a cancer, Arkady..." he said, frustrated with his inability to stop the cretin. "He buys who he buys, and it seems like nowadays everyone has their price." The usually-loquacious Popov seemed dismal, while Antonov, ever the deadpan figure, remained steel-faced. "Well?" asked Bunyachenko. "What do we do now?"\n\nPopov nervously checked his watch, and was about to answer when a sharp rap at the door interrupted him. Before Bunyachenko could even ask who was interrupting him, four of his personal guards entered, their weapons drawn. Rising from his desk, Bunyachenko asked, "What is going on?" a tone of suspicion was confirmed as he looked to Popov and Antonov, who had since stood up and drawn their sidearms.\n\n"Sergey Bunyachenko," Antonov started, "The Officers Committee has placed you under arrest following an investigation into corruption and nepotism charges. We have reviewed the case and have sentenced you to death. Please don't make this harder than it already is."

Signaling his bodyguards to be on alert, he took his old sidearm out of the drawer of his desk and prepared himself. It was obvious that Oktan was planning something, the spider was always planning something, but he didn't expect him to be so bold.\n\nBunyachenko signaled his guards again, and they began to move for the emergency exit. However, before they could get far, a group of men burst through the door. They were a squad of ROA regulars led by a group of civilian administrators. The man at their front spoke quickly, "Chairman Bunyachenko, you are under arrest for actions against the people of Russia. Please, take a seat." Before he could so much as twitch, he had been disarmed by his own bodyguards, the traitors, and tied to his desk chair.\n\nThe conspirator made to speak again, but before he could yet another group burst into his office, this time through the front door. Once again, a squad of ROA regulars was being led into his office, but this time it was one of Oktan's lackeys at their head. Before they even attempted to make demands the civilians fled and a fight began in the close confines of the office.\n\nWith the commotion as a distraction, Bunyachenko was able to loosen the bonds around him and escape through the open door. As he descended through the chaos left in the wake of Oktan's men, he rallied some loyal officers and troops. With their help, the conspirators were rounded up or killed, and calm descended once again on Samara. The coming days would be trying, the traitors would need to be destroyed root and stem, but for now, he had peace."

If we lay down our guns now, our movement will be saved and no one will be hurt. Our enemies won't be able to take advantage of the internal divisions that they have been encouraging for months. Remember, struggle not against your family, but against those who threaten it!"\n\nToday, Zykov took to the air to announce the end of the mutinies and to encourage those still in arms to give up, offering amnesty to all those who were not involved in instigating the mutiny. The path to end the mutiny and prevent an all-out explosion of the ROA into civil war was engineered masterfully by the veteran propagandist, who seemed to exhibit perfectly the tenets that Macchiavelli wrote about centuries ago. Zykov had bribed those who could be bought, talked down those who could be talked, and threatened violence upon those who would do neither. The combination worked, if just barely. Armed confrontation was reserved to a few hardcore mutineers, who utterly refused surrender. All of these facts, and the immense amount of relief given by them, was swirling around the heads of the committee, which Zykov stood in front of. The enigmatic orator had already given a cursory briefing to the committee about the situation, and the fallout. However, his coup-de-grace was yet to come. "As I'm sure all of you are aware, it was the perfidious Mikhail Oktan, who organized this mutiny against the authority of our dear chairman." Actually, for most, that was a surprise. "Indeed, it's clear, at least to me, that we can no longer tolerate such a rat-like insubordinate in our ranks, no matter how entrenched he may be." Zykov looked around this room, his cool, calculating gaze analyzing each committee member. He was confident in their vote. One by one, each consented to Oktan's arrest. "Very well. If it is the will of the committee, I will order the arrest of Mikhail Oktan and his subsequent trial."\n\nOktan would not get a trial. After his arrest, during which he made no small protest, he was taken to a small barn near the outskirts of Samara, and given a sentencing, ultimately being shot. His body was burned. Such was the end of Mikhail Oktan."

The former journalist did not walk into the office so much as he tumbled in, pushed around by the weight of events.\n\n"Zykov. Good to see you." The democratic activist began to speak, only for the chairman to cut him off. "No, please let me continue. Right now, a tidal wave of shit is threatening to wash away our progress. The officer's committee believes that Oktan is behind everything that's happening right now in the army and the liberated territories. You have ten minutes to convince me that you've got nothing to do with the rabble spreading havoc throughout the northern provinces."\n\n"And why would I try to convince some puppet of the officer committee? I should go see them directly"\n\nBunyachenko smiled a little. Something of Zykov's old bravado remained. That was good. "The officer committee are useless, tired old men. On that, you, Oktan and I agree. No, Zykov, you will argue your case with me. You are an eloquent fellow. If you convince me that you can be of use, perhaps you'll see some of your dreams realized. I'm in the market for new... associates."\n\nZykov's eyes shone a little brighter. Or had it been just an illusion?

This treacherous attempt to destroy the last hope of all Russians came to a head just days ago when units loyal to Sergei Bunyachenko attempted to storm the central districts of our state, supported by tanks, saboteurs, and artillery.\n\nHowever, just before these extremists and blackguards reached the residence of our great leader Zykov, the stalwart loyalists among the Russian Liberation Army mobilized to prevent the overthrow, and save our movement from destruction. Overwhelmed by the stern defence of these brave soldiers and surrounded on all sides by a jeering populace, the putschists soon felt the jaws of the state closing in around their pathetic rebellion, and fled to the outlying districts, where they soon turned to brigandry to survive. Commander Bunyachenko has called for peace and reconciliation, claiming that the putschists had nothing to do with him or the officer's committee. While the disloyal general is likely to be kept on the general staff, his political career is widely seen as irreparably damaged.

That meant that the ferrymen had to be bribed, because they didn't just ship any random fellow's goods. The same went for the sheet metal, which was mostly moved overland past checkpoints belonging to another warlord. Another round of bribes. Then, at one of the narrowest points along the Volga, some shitheads had pulled up a chain, blocking the boats, and would only lower it if they were convinced... with some more bribes. The oldest one couldn't have been more than twenty. Leo still grimaced at the memory of his shit-eating smile. Finally, all their supplies had arrived in Kazan. After the local thug who owned their assigned docks had been suitably bribed, the materiel was moved to the construction site.\n\nWhen a man who went by "Xösäyen the Turk" sauntered up and declared that he owned the site, and would be charging a rent, Leo Ivanovyich bit his tongue to keep from screaming."

These were lean times; such things were immensely rare for the common man.\n\n"So," the girl began, "isn't it lucky that we have the whole place to ourselves?" The officer put his hand on his chin and made a great show of thinking, as if he found the situation to be the height of mystery. In reality, he knew exactly what had happened: a truly spectacular bribe to the manager was all it took to make him refuse all the other patrons' reservations.\n\n"Certainly, my darling, but sometimes things have their way of working out.\n\n"Tell me a bit about your service. My parents always said that the ROA were nothing but crooks, but I don't think so at all. I think you're very brave." An image of his paying for the jewels with protection money flashed through his mind, but he pushed it aside. He cycled through memories to see if he had any good ones, but they were all of the same kind.

Already some skirmishes between their troops had resulted in deaths, and they seemed to be stockpiling arms to go to war. The dispute was, as far as he could make out, more about mutual loathing than anything else. Oktan sighed. The odd massacre across the border he could wave away. This was an internal matter, and required action. One of the warlords was a bonehead, but of the other he had expected more.\n\n"This could have waited until after the party," said Oktan, watching the aide wither under his glare.

It is clear from his face that the old man would rather not be there; it is also clear that he knows he has no choice.\n\n"Konstantin Kromiadi." Oktan is sitting in his office chair, grinning at the man and motioning for his guards to leave the room. "How good it is to see that you remain in good health. I've heard you've finally decided to pledge your loyalty to me. A wise decision, very like you."\n\nKromiadi does not show the disgust he feels with himself and Oktan both, and simply nods. Bunyachenko would understand. "Yes, and I thank you for the mercy you've shown me." Kromiadi began, his voice raspy. "However, that still doesn't explain why you've decided to summon me to your office."\n\nThinking for a moment, Oktan nodded slowly to himself. "I'm sure you've heard of my recent appointments of Fyodor Truhin and Victor Polyakov to Central Siberia, among others." Kromiadi had indeed heard. He had never known Truhin to have strong stances on much of anything for all the years that he'd known him, but Polyakov had come as a surprise; even he knew little about the man, so what Oktan saw in him, he might never know.\n\n"I have, what of it?" Kromiadi asked.\n\n"How would you like to help govern West Siberia on my behalf, being as clever and wise as you are?" Oktan asked, a venomous edge to his words. He clearly held no love for Kromiadi, but some problem was troubling him, something he was unable to solve on his own. If he accepted, Kromiadi considered, he might be able to pursue Bunyachenko's vision to some extent. And if he refused, Oktan very well might decide to take out his unusual frustration on him. His choice was clear."

He did not shake in his boots, or look around anxiously, or try to avoid Oktan's gaze. He simply stared straight ahead, not at Oktan but past him, with a slight frown on his face.\n\n"Fyodor!" Oktan exclaimed with a grin. A fake one, Truhin thought. "I haven't had the chance to meet with you in forever. Are you well?"\n\nA few seconds of silence passed before Truhin answered. He tapped his finger impatiently on his leg. The pleasantries were the worst, least efficient part of any conversation. "Yes." He finally replied. "I am well. Now what is it that you really called me here to speak about? My execution or my promotion?"\n\nOktan chuckled at that response, though Truhin did not understand what was so funny. "Straight to the point as always, Fyodor. That's why I like you, you're quick to get results no matter how you have to get them." Truhin's tapping of his finger on his leg increased in pace, and Oktan cleared his throat. "Fortunately for you, it's a promotion. You're being appointed to govern a territory in Western Siberia on my behalf, a reward for all your years of loyalty and dedication." That last part was definitely a lie, but Truhin did not particularly care. All that mattered was that he wasn't going to die today. It was all that had ever mattered in his career, really.\n\nThe tapping of his finger stopped, though his bored expression did not change. "I see. Thank you for this opportunity. I will fulfill the obligations of this new role." As he got up and opened the door to leave, he heard Oktan mutter one last thing."

The Russian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the Siberian region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling USD 40,000,000. The Russian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Russian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.\n\nYou assistance is requested as a non-Russian citizen to assist the Russian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Russia, in moving these funds out of Russia. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Russian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Russian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or USD 4 million of this amount.\n\nHowever, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Russian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least USD 100,000 in a Russian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nIf it will be possible for you to assist us, we would be most grateful. We suggest that you meet with us in person in Samara, and that during your visit I introduce you to the representatives of the Russian National Petroleum Company, as well as with certain officials of the Central Bank of Russia.\n\nPlease call me at your earliest convenience at 18-467-4975.

From what he heard in Sverdlovsk back in the day, they were traitorous bastards from Western Russia.\n\nOn the other hand, the administration was still very nice towards him, except for placing him in Omsk of course. Still, he was given many resources to maintain stability in the territories under his control, and any threat of Black League remnants was swiftly taken care of by the army.\n\nYet did the ROA really work towards the good of Russia, or were the rumors of them being collaborators true? Was it bad to help the ROA achieve their goals and help them maintain control of their new territories?

People may even take an interest in the opposition and democracy as they continue to exist. Everything is only starting to take shape.\n\nHowever, the opposition party being allowed into power is not making things easy for us, even with our large majority.

Ironic, then, that Germany was riddled with rot, resting atop a mountain of corpses created by the civil war. Rotten foundations indeed, thought Bayerski.\n\nHe stopped fiddling with his tie for a moment, his hands falling to his side slowly as he fixed his gaze with that of his reflection. God, did he really look so old? So tired? He remembered the flight from Poland, his capture by the hated Germans, his own terrible shame at serving in their puppet army. He looked into his own eyes and saw horrors laid over horrors, a waking nightmare that would not end. Bayerski blinked, forcing down the screams, rattling machine guns, and the smell of smoke and blood that threatened to overtake him in that moment. No, he was in control.

Born in the city of Arkhangelsk during the darkest years of the German invasion, he and his family had relocated to the city of Syktyvkar in 1960, when the 18-year-old Turgenev had nearly been drafted into the army of the Soviet remnants based in the Far North. Syktyvkar had only proved to be more trouble than Arkhangelsk had been, however. Unlike in red territory, the so-called Komi Republic allowed free discourse, attracting to them a number of politicians from across the political spectrum. This, of course, had bred conflict, which had drawn Turgenev's two brothers into the politicking. Each of them had been killed during political intrigues in the capital - God rest their souls. But Turgenev knew that, for all the terrible things that free and open discourse brought, it was, at the end of the day, just that: free and open.\n\nWhen the Russian Liberation Army entered the city and paraded themselves around as if they were "liberating" the people, Turgenev worried. He had become accustomed and made peace with the freedom and its consequences that had been afforded to him through the Komi Republic, and for better or worse, he could at the very least speak his mind. When the ROA seized the city, he couldn't see anything but dark days ahead. But as weeks turned into months, and months into years, Turgenev realized that life under the ROA wasn't too bad. They had promised peace and democracy.\n\nWhile the former had come, the latter was only just beginning to manifest. One evening, as Turgenev made his usual walk home, he passed an ROA recruiting poster. A stoic man in uniform pointed towards him, asking him to protect his family and his homeland. A thought crossed Turgenev's mind, and he remembered that both of his brothers had died for a cause they believed in."

Far better for his evening walks to be in the presidential palace's gardens. Gardens were a bit too grandiose a word, Bunyachenko thought, for the half finished assembly of shrubs and plants.\n\nWalking loops around the closed garden, the president's thoughts were free to wander beyond the confine of the park. Politics was a new career for him. A soldier's life had been his, after joining the red army as a teenager. Hard fighting in the plains of Ukraine, against the whites and the Ukrainian National Republic. Bunyachenko had been free, then. He and his comrades, fighting for a new Russian nation, freed from archaic tsarism, fighting with the naivety of youth for a better future. After the civil war he had been deployed to central Asia, fighting Basmachi rebels. Different plains, but the same endless blue sky. The president smiled bitterly. Freedom, as always, was wasted on the young.\n\nThe Reds had turned out no better than the Tsar. Endless court politics, as Bukharin's boyars ran roughshod over the country. Ukraine had not been spared their incompetence. Fields of gold, exploited by faceless bureaucrats. Neither had Bunyachenko. Yet he had kept fighting. Accused by the paranoid men in Moscow of failing to win a war their incompetence had caused to be doomed from the start. He had fought on then, naively, too. Being captured by the Germans had merely confirmed the Red's paranoid accusations that he was a traitor.\n\nHe hated the Germans for destroying Russia. Truth be told, however, they had merely ended what the Bukharinists had begun. It felt good to know that the WRRF was dead and buried. Now all the President had to do was to destroy the Germans, kick over their own rotting structure. Perhaps then he would truly be free, innocent in the court of public opinion. Until then he had to keep following orders. Stuck in the presidential palace, Sergey Bunyachenko continued his evening walk round and round his prison's courtyard."

A small band played the Japanese national anthem as Bunyachenko confidently shook the hands of the Japanese delegates before escorting them to a line of gleaming automobiles, surrounded by an honor guard.\n\nPerhaps they expected a ramshackle hovel, the cramped presidential palace of yet another Russian warlord with delusions of grandeur. And, had they wandered beyond the main streets, they might have been correct. But Bunyachenko left nothing to chance: the Japanese sun flag hung from freshly-installed lampposts, while the Japanese emissaries silently watched the meticulously cleaned and spotless cityscape roll past.\n\nThe Japanese were a people of order, of punctuality, of proper appearances. And they were arrogant - an opportunity Bunyachenko would not squander.\n\nMuch later, as Bunyachenko bade the Japanese good night after a sumptuous, extravagant banquet, the Mitsubishi representative laughed drunkenly to his colleagues, forgetting the presence of Bunyachenko's translator: "If only half the Sphere were as agreeable as these Russians!"

Housing was a right for hardworking Russians, the former military man declared over and over in his speeches. As was education. The father saw his children's school books on the table, neatly stacked at the end of the day. Homeworks had been dutifully completed. Dmitry's penmanship was not great for a ten years old. But he had learned to read so fast. If only their mother could have seen all this. The small ones worked so hard.\n\nAt this hour of the day, his only companion was the bottle. A little drink, to soothe the day's pains. He had to take long hours, to keep his children fed, to keep qualifying for free apartments near the train station. The pay was good. What were a few aches at the end of the day? All of Russia was being rebuilt. All of Russia...\n\nThe man caught himself pouring a third glass. He put the bottle back in the keyboards, locked it with a key. It would not do for the little one to try their father's medecine. The third glass went down easy, quenching his thirst for warmth.\n\nEveryone was working so hard. President Bunyachenko's economic miracle would leave his children a better nation. The father knew, hoped, that the president shared the workers' hard schedule. Many dismissed Bunyachenko as a traitor. The father knew better. All had done terrible things in the Rusisan Anarchy to survive. The father... No, better not follow that line of thought.\n\nThe president claimed things would get better, work shifts would get easier as the industry advanced. The father hoped they would.

From her home-one of the new townhouses on a tree-lined promenade-the car passes rotting apartments and tin sheds. Many of her employees live here. She used to, too, back when she was one of the first woman engineers at Ukhta's main refinery. She slept on the floor, and her daughter slept on their couch. Now, her daughter goes to school in Samara. Every week, Yulechka writes a letter home to her mother. The uniforms at that school make her look quite sharp.\n\nAt the refinery, she marches through halls and across worksites, accompanied by the sycophants that she calls her staff. They supervise the visbrakers and catalytic crackers and pipelines that send oil from Ukhta to... well, to everywhere. The black insignia of Rosneft is emblazoned on storage tanks across western Russia, after all. The Queen, in turn, supervises them. It's a good job. Everyone strives for a good job these days, especially since so few can get them. It gnaws at her, some days. The guilt. The feeling that she has betrayed something, someone.

 SAM_bunyachenko.6.desc:0 ""So, what's your name?"\n\n"Aleksandr Pavlovich Korolev, but you can call me Shura!" The young man flashes a cheery smile. There's unease in his stomach. This isn't the first interview he's done, but his flight leaves in a week. The security official in front of him is making sure that the flight will be worth it.\n\n"And, Shura, what brings you to the Tokyo Institute of Technology? It's very prestigious, as you know."\n\nHe's prepared for this answer. Drilled on it for months, ever since the embossed envelope arrived at his family's apartment in Syzran. "I want to help build my country. Russia has been engulfed in war for far too long, and I want to build the bridges, roads, and dams that will tie us together in the future."\n\nThe official nods, flashes the tiniest hint of a smile. "And, Shura, what do you think of your government? I hear it's... well, it's so barbaric and oppressive!"\n\nHe's drilled for this, too. "President Bunyachenko wants what is best for the nation. I'm here to learn the skills that will help improve Russia, and that's what's much more important to me. Besides, I'd rather not talk about politics."\n\nThere's a bigger smile this time.\n\n"Thank you, Aleksandr. I think that we're all done here. Have a good semester.""

 SAM_bunyachenko.7.desc:0 "Anna was surrounded by placards floating in a lake of blood.\n\nNext to her, Anatoly's face was frozen in a startled gasp, as he had seen the soldiers drive up to the gate. He had been the most incensed by Kolya falling into the furnace three weeks before, saying that they couldn't just stand by and watch, even after the managers had told them that it was a fool's errand.\n\nShe saw gentle Sofia, her sister in arms, both literal and figurative, who had tended to the bruises of the workers after the police had beaten the striking workers black and blue. Her limp legs daubed blood across the floor of the Vyatka steel mill.\n\nWhere was Aleksey? His diminutive stature masked the ferocity of his intelligence, as he had excoriated the Vyatka executive who had warned them that this was their last chance. She squinted at a mountain of bodies being piled near the furnace, and found his bullet-ridden corpse at the top.\n\nSo many dead, for Kolya. Her darling son, her only son, swallowed by that infernal furnace because the kombinats couldn't be assed to put up railings in their factories -\n\nA kick to her side. The cold pressure of a rifle barrel to her forehead. The blinding glare of a flashlight. "We've got a live one," the soldier called out. "She's the ringleader, check the manifesto."\n\nA few seconds passed before the officer pronounced Anna's sentence. "Bring her in and put her in isolation. We can erase the communists without martyring too many of them.""

 SAM_bunyachenko.8.desc:0 ""And what happened at the Vyatka plant? We gave them a final offer; did they take it?" Minister Semyon didn't look up from the stack of documents he was signing as he mentioned the wildcat strike.\n\n"No, they didn't." The aide fidgeted in place. A few seconds of silence. Semyon's hand stopped.\n\n"How many?"\n\n"Forty-four dead, with three taken into custody. All the criminals have been accounted for and production has resumed." The aide coughed. "The operation was successful."\n\nSemyon pinched the bridge of his nose. "An entire shift dead. And production levels?"\n\n"Not back up to full capacity, unfortunately. But it was the most efficient way to remove the disruption; we'll have their replacements trained shortly."\n\n"And what happens when they go on strike?" Semyon slammed his palm on the desk. "Considering the cost and time to even bring the new ones up to scratch, it hardly strikes me as efficient."\n\n"And what do we do about the agitators and their demands?" The aide replied.\n\n"Give them what they want for now. Then raise the production targets by five percent. We'll see who complains after that.""

 SAM_bunyachenko.9.desc:0 "A knock came at Bunyachenko's door. "Enter." He commanded, glancing up from the pile of papers on his desk.\n\nEntering through the opening door was Constantine Kromiadi, a thin, older Greek with a small moustache, who had long been Bunyachenko's head of security in spite of his unassuming appearance- or perhaps because of it. "I came to speak with you about our... spy problem, for lack of a better term." He rasped.\n\n"Which one? The American, the Japanese, or the German one?" Bunyachenko asked in reply. Kromiadi let out a small chuckle, but stopped when he saw his boss wasn't laughing.\n\n"All of them, old friend." Kromiadi cleared his throat. "Though especially the German one. The Japanese and the Americans could be beneficial to us if they realize the strength of our forces and seek a partnership, but in any case they are manageable. The Germans, however, will never be our friends, as they've proven time and time again, yet they have the deepest connections amongst our forces, thanks to Oktan, that bastard."\n\nResting his head in his hand, Bunyachenko thought a moment. "So we must root them out, without hurting American and Japanese spies too much, and without alerting the men to our intentions so they don't begin thinking we've gone soft on the Americans and Japanese." After a silent moment, Bunyachenko continued. "I have full faith in your ability to handle it, but inform me immediately if you need additional resources. Oh, and one more thing. Between the Americans and the Japanese, Kromiadi, which do you think is more trustworthy for Russia?"\n\nKromiadi hesitated a moment, then nodded. "The Americans, sir, though either would suit our purposes.""
